Building Athplay
----------------
'athplay' is not built/included by default.
Makefile.[platform] needs to be modified for the athplay to be built and included as part of fs.
To build - just add "athplay_tools_fus" to 'Makefile.[platform]'

Playing
-------
Prerequisite: Refer to README of "../../linux/drivers/i2s/"

$ athplay [-r] <file>

e.g.,

To Play:
$ athplay test.wav

To Record:
$ athplay -r rec.wav

To Pause/Resume:
