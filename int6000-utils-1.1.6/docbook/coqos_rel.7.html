coqos_rel(7)                          Intellon Linux Toolkit                         coqos_rel(7)

NAME
       coqos_rel - Release Bandwidth Management

SYNOPSIS
       coqos_rel [options] cid [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       This page is under construction.

       Instructs  one  or more devices to stop managing a stream. Use this program when bandwidth
       management is no longer needed or wanted. Use program  coqos_mod  to  suspend  and  resume
       bandwidth management of a stream.

       This  program  is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for an overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout. By convention status and  error  messages  are
              printed  on  stderr  while primary program output is printed on stdout. This option
              prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i interface
              Select the host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via  this  interface  and
              only  reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface is
              eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle network  connection;  however,
              if  environment  string  &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -r     Display relative memory offsets on output. This option is the default.

       -v     Prints additional information on stdout. In particular, this option dumps  outgoing
              Ethernet packets on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Displays  program help information on stderr. This option takes precedence over all
              other options on the command line except version information.

       -!,--version
              Displays program version information on stderr. This option takes  precedence  over
              all other options on the command line except help information. Use this option when
              sending screen dumps to Intellon technical staff.

ARGUMENTS
       cid    The connection identifier of the affected stream.

       device The MAC address of some powerline device. More than one address may be specified on
              the  command  line.  If more than one address is specified then operations are per‐
              formed on each device in turn. The default address is &quot;local&quot;. See DEVICES for more
              information.

DEVICES
       Ethernet  MAC  addresses  are  expressed as six hexadecimal octets optionally separated by
       colon. For example, the Intellon Local Management Address (LMA) of &quot;00b052000001&quot; may also
       be  entered  as &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; or &quot;00b052:000001&quot;. Addresses are case insensitive and
       quotes are optional. In addition, some special addresses may be  entered  by  name  rather
       than number where names are case sensitive.

       all    A synonym for the &quot;broadcast&quot; address, described next.

       broadcast
              A  synonym  for  the  Ethernet  broadcast  address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. All devices,
              whether local, remote or foreign will respond to this address.

       local  A synonym  for  the  Intellon  vendor  specific  Local  Management  Address  (LMA),
              00:B0:52:00:00:01. All local Intellon devices recognize this address but remote and
              foreign devices do not. A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline
              connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Intellon.

EXAMPLES
       The next example instructs device 00:B0:52:BA:BE&quot;01 to release stream 803. The stream will
       the remain unmanaged indefinitely.
