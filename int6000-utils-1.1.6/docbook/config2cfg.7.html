config(7)                             Intellon Linux Toolkit                            config(7)

NAME
       config2cfg - Intellon Configuration File Converter

SYNOPSIS
       config2cfg [options] file [file] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  config2cfg  program  converts  an SDRAM configuration file used by the Windows Device
       Manager to the configuration file format used by the Linux Toolkit.

       This program is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for  an  overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       There are no options.

EXPLANATION
       The  Windows Device Manager format consists of 64 ASCII hexadecomal characters and usually
       have a .config extension. File size is at  least  64  characters.  Excess  characters  are
       ignored  in  input.  Files can be modified with any text editor. There is no way to detect
       modification. ASCII to binary convertion and checksum computation is  required  on  input.
       Binary to ASCII conversion iw required on output.

       The  Linux Toolkit foremat consists of 32 binary bytes plus a 4 byte (32 bit) checksum and
       usually have a .cfg extension. File size is exactly 36 characters. The files can be edited
       using any hex editor but a new checksum must be computed and inserted after any change. No
       conversion or computation is required on input or output.

       You can use the chkcfg utility to determine if a given file has the proper  Linux  Toolkit
       SDRAM configuration file format. Programs int6k and int6kf expect this format.

OPTIONS
       file   The  filename of a Windows Device Manager SDRAM configuration file. The file is re-
              written such that the filename is preserved  but  the  contents  are  not.  Windows
              Device  Manager  SDRAM configuration files usually have a .config extension but the
              program makes no assumption based on filename and does  not  enforce  any  filename
              conventions.

       -q     Suppresses  printing  of  progress messages. There are no progress messages in this
              version.

       -v     Print additional information. There is no additional information  printed  in  this
              version.

       -?, --help
              Print  program  help  summary  on  stdout.  This option takes precedence over other
              options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over
              other  options  on  the  command  line. Usethis option when sending screen dumps to
              Intellon Technical Support so that they know exactly which  version  of  the  Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example  reads  file abc.cfg and validates it. The message shown indicates
       that the configuration file is the correct size and has a checksums and there are no  read
       errors.

           &gt; chkcfg abc.cfg
           chkcfg: abc.cfg looks good

       The  following  example  reads  three files in succession and reports on each one. You can
       suppress good news with the -q option.

           # chkcfg abc.cfg def.cfg ghi.cfg
           chkcfg: abc.cfg looks good
           chkcfg: def.cfg is corrupt
           chkcfg: ghi.cfg looks good

       The following example displays the SDRAM configuration values in all  files  having  names
       that match the wildcard pattern sdram*.cfg. We can confirm that the values inside are cor‚Äê
       rect for their filenames. Program output could have been sent to  a  file  and  saved  for
       later reference.

           # chknvm -qv sdram*.cfg
           ------- sdram32.cfg -------
                   SIZE=0x02000000 (32mb)

                   TIM0=0x01E1D491
                   TIM1=0x000883D6
                   CNTRL=0x00003089
                   REF=0x00000366
                   CLOCK=0x00000001
           ------- sdram16.cfg -------
                   SIZE=0x01000000 (16mb)
                   CONF=0x00142F68
                   TIM0=0x0115124E
                   TIM1=0x000883D6
                   CNTRL=0x00003089
                   REF=0x00000493
                   CLOCK=0x00000001
