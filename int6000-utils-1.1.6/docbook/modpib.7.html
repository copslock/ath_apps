modpib(7)                             Intellon Linux Toolkit                            modpib(7)

NAME
       modpib - Intellon PIB File Editor

SYNOPSIS
       modpib [options] filename

DESCRIPTION
       Change  device identity parameters in a PIB file and updated the checksum. Device identity
       parameters are the MAC, DAK, NMK and the Manufacturer,  Network  and  User  HFID.  Collec‐
       tively, they establish the device network identity.

       This program is the safe way to edit identity parameters since only valid PIB files can be
       edited and only selected values changed. In addition, critical cross-parameter updates are
       automatically applied.

       This  program  is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for an overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -C mode
              Set Central Coordinator Selection mode.  Permitted  values  for  mode  are  0=Auto,
              1=Never, 2=Always and 3=UserAssigned.

       -D xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
              The  new  Device Access Key (DAK). This key will replace the original DAK. Keys are
              16 hex octet strings. Octets may be seperated by optional colons. The symbol  none,
              key1  or  key2  may be specified in place of a hexadecimal string, for convenience.
              Use program hpavkey to compute the DAK for a specific password, if required.

       -L level
              Set security level. The security level is written into the  PreferredNID.  Level  0
              enables pusbutton pairing. Level 1 disables it. The default secutity level is 0.

       -M xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
              The  new Media Access Control (MAC) address. This address will replace the original
              address, if specified. Addresses are 6 hex octet strings. Octets may  be  seperated
              by optional colons.

              Intellon  powerline devices derive their MAC address from their PIB and each device
              on a network must have a unique address. To facilitate the  assignement  of  unique
              addresses,  substituting  the  word  auto, next or plus will cause the original MAC
              address to be incremented before a new checksum is calculated. Successive  uses  of
              this  option  will  continue  to  increment the stored address. You can inspect the
              stored MAC address with &quot;chkpib -v pibfile&quot;.

       -N xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
              The new Network Membership Key (NMK). This key will replace the original NMK,  cre‐
              ate  a  new  PreferredNID and clear the AVLNMembership bit. Keys are 16 hex octets.
              Optionally, octets may be seperated colons. The symbol key1 or key2 can  be  speci‐
              fied in place of a hexadecimal string, for convenience. Use program hpavkey to com‐
              pute the NMK from a specific password, if required.

       -P filename
              The specified file is loaded from disk and written into the  prescaler  section  of
              the  PIB.  This file must be in the format used by the Intellon Windows Device Man‐
              ager, which is a two column file, each column consisting of 8  ASCII  alpha-numeric
              characters. The first column corresponds to the array index value (00000000 through
              00001155, decimal), and the second column is the value stored at that  position  in
              the  prescaler  array (00000000 through 000000ff, hexadecimal). The two columns may
              be separated by any whitespace characters when using this tool. However,  for  full
              compatibility  with  the Windows Device Manager it is advised to use a single space
              between the columns. The ’#’ character may also be used at the start of a  line  to
              denote a comment.

       -S string
              The new manufacturing string. The maximum length is 63 characters.

       -T string
              The new network name string. The maximum length is 63 character.

       -U string
              The new username string. The maximum length is 63 characters.

       -q     Enable quiet mode. This opation has no effect at present.

       -v     Print edited PIB identity information on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Print  program  help  summary  on  stdout.  This option takes precedence over other
              options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over
              other  options  on  the  command  line. Usethis option when sending screen dumps to
              Intellon Technical Support so that they know exactly which  version  of  the  Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       filename
              The  name of the PIB file to be modified. No assumptions are made based on filename
              and no filename conventions are enforced.

KEYS
       Encryption keys are long, tedious to type and prone to error. For  convenience,  the  sym‐
       bolic  names  may  be  used to specify the key for options -D and -K. Symbolic name &quot;none&quot;
       translates to zeros. Symbolic name &quot;key1&quot; translates to the HomePlug AV compliant key  for
       pass phrase &quot;HomePlugAV&quot;. Symbolic name &quot;key2&quot; translates to the HomePlug AV compliant key
       for pass phrase &quot;HomePlugAV0123&quot;.

EXAMPLES
       The following example replaces the MAC address in pib file  abc.pib  and  computes  a  new
       checksum. The input file is over-written. A command like this one can be used to establish
       the start MAC address when downloading a series of PIBs.

          # modpib -M 00:b0:52:DA:DA:FF abc.pib

       The following example increments the MAC address in pib file abc.pib and  computes  a  new
       checksum.  The  word auto, next or plus, in place of a MAC address, will increment the old
       address each time the command is executed. This command can be used to ensure that  unique
       and consequtive MAC addresses are used each time a PIB is downloaded.

          # modpib -M auto abc.pib

       The  following  command updates pib file abc.pib with the DAK and NMK read from the device
       connected to eth0. In similar fashion, program rkey can be used to compute random key val‐
       ues from a keyfile.

          # modpib -D $(int6kid -Di eth0) -N $(rkey secret.key -M) abc.pib

       The  following  example  displays the current value of keys and strings stored in pib file
       v3.3.1.pib because option -v is present. This can be used to inspect PIB identity settings
       prior to download.

          # chkpib -v v3.3.1.pib
          ------- v3.3.1.pib -------
                PIB 3-5 8072 bytes
                MAC 00:B0:52:00:00:01
                DAK 50:D3:E4:93:3F:85:5B:70:40:78:4D:F8:15:AA:8D:B7
                NMK 50:D3:E4:93:3F:85:5B:70:40:78:4D:F8:15:AA:8D:B7 (HomePlugAV)
