setnvm(7)                             Intellon Linux Toolkit                            setnvm(7)

NAME
       setnvm - Intellon Image File Mangler

SYNOPSIS
       setnvm [options] file [file] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Set  special  fields of the image header for every image in an Intellon image file. Do not
       use this program without Intellon support because it  can  easily  render  an  image  file
       invalid  or,  worse,  render  a powerline device inoperable. Detailed information on field
       values has been omitted on purpose. If you have to ask then you should  probably  not  use
       this program.

       Use  program  chknvm with the -v option to inspect image file contents. If a file contains
       images that should not have their Type or Omit fields changed,  use  program  nvmsplit  to
       break  out the images, change those that need it then use program nvmmerge to combine them
       again.

       This program is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for  an  overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -t imagetype
              Set  the  Image  Type field for every image in the file. This 8-bit value indicates
              the nature of the image and is used by Intellon firmware and  application  software
              to  determine  if an image should be downloaded and executed. Values can be entered
              in decimal, binary or hexadecimal. Binary values must be  prefixed  with  &quot;0b&quot;  and
              hexadecimal  values  must  be  prefixed with &quot;0x&quot;. The imagetype must be one of the
              following values:

               0 NVM_IMAGE_GENERIC
               1 NVM_IMAGE_CONFIG_SYNOPSIS
               2 NVM_IMAGE_CONFIG_DENALI
               3 NVM_IMAGE_APPLET_DENALI
               4 NVM_IMAGE_FIRMWARE
               5 NVM_IMAGE_OASCLIENT
               6 NVM_IMAGE_CUSTOM
               7 NVM_IMAGE_MEMCTL

       -o hostmask
              Set the Image Omit field for every image in the file. This 16-bit value is a bitmap
              of  Intellon  platforms  that  the image does not support. Values may be entered in
              decimal, binary or hexadecimal. Binary values must be prefixed with &quot;0b&quot;  and  hex‚Äê
              adecimal  values  must be prefixed with &quot;0x&quot;. The hostmask may be the logical OR of
              any of the following values:

               1 INT6000
               2 INT6300
               4 INT6400

       -q     Suppress printing of routine messages. This option has no effect at this time.  All
              error messages are printed.

       -v     Print image headers on stdout as they are processed.

       -?, --help
              Print  program  help  summary  on  stdout.  This option takes precedence over other
              options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over
              other  options  on  the  command  line. Usethis option when sending screen dumps to
              Intellon Technical Support so that they know exactly which  version  of  the  Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The name of an Intellon image file. By convention, Intellon Image files have a .nvm
              file extension but this program does not enforce  this  convention.  Invalid  image
              files will be rejected causing the output to be incomplete.

EXAMPLES
       None.

       Firmware  file structure and content is proprietary to Intellon Corporation, Ocala FL USA.
       Consequently, public information is not available. Intellon Corporation reserves the right
       to  change file structure or content in future firmware releases without any obligation to
