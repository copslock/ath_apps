int6kecho(7)                          Intellon Linux Toolkit                         int6kecho(7)

NAME
       int6kecho - Intellon Loopback Message Utility

SYNOPSIS
       int6kecho [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Send  an  Ethernet frame to some Intellon powerline device and instruct the device to echo
       that frame once per second for a given period of time using the  Intellon  VS_FR_LBK  mes‐
       sage. This message is intended for diagnostic purposes and has no practical application in
       an operational environment. Users must sign a formal non-diclosure agreement with Intellon
       before using this program.

       This  program  is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for an overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -f filename
              A frame description file. When this option is present, the named file is read, con‐
              verted to binary format and used that the VS_FR_LBK message payload. It defines the
              Ethernet frame to be echoed by the target device. The frame will be  padded  to  60
              bytes  or truncated to 1038 bytes, as needed, to accommodate the VS_FR_LBK message.
              See efsu for more information on frame description files. If this option  is  omit‐
              ted, a default frame or pre-programmed frame is used.

       -i interface
              Select  the  host  Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this interface and
              only reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface  is
              eth1  because  most people use eth0 as their principle network connection; however,
              if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence  over  the  default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -q     Suppress  normal  progress  and  status messages. This option has no effect at this
              time.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout. Specifically, this option  prints  incoming
              and  outgoing  frames  in hexadecimal format on stdout. Output can be directed to a
              text file for analysis.

       -?, --help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over  other
              options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print  program  version  information  on  stdout. This option takes precedence over
              other options on the command line. Use this option when  sending  screen  dumps  to
              Intellon  Technical  Support  so  that they know exactly which version of the Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The MAC address of some powerline device. More than one address may  be  specified.
              If  more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device
              in turn. The default address is local. See DEVICES for information  about  symbolic
              device addresses.

DEVICES
       Powerline  devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. MAC addresses are 12
       hexadecimal digits (0123456789ABCDEFabcdef) in upper,  lower  or  mixed  case.  Individual
       octets  may  be separated by colons, for clarity, but not all octets need to be seperated.
       For example, &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equiva‐
       lent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be expressed by name instead of number.

       all    Equivalent to &quot;broadcast&quot;, described next.

       broadcast
              A  synonym  for  the  standard  Ethernet  broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. All
              devices, whether local, remote or foreign will respond to this address.

       local  A synonym  for  the  Intellon  vendor  specific  Local  Management  Address  (LMA),
              00:B0:52:00:00:01.  All  local  Intellon  devices  will  recognize this address but
              remote and foreign devices will not. A remote device is any device at the  far  end
              of  a  powerline  connection.  A  foreign  device is any device not manufactured by
              Intellon.

DISCLAIMER
       Intellon HomePlug AV Vendor Specific Management Message Entry  structure  and  content  is
       proprietary  to  Intellon  Corporation, Ocala FL USA. Consequently, public information may
       not available. Intellon Corporation reserves the right to  modify  message  structure  and
       content  in  future firmware releases without any obligation to notify or compensate users
       of this program.

EXAMPLES
       The following example sends the Ethernet frame defined in file abc.hex to powerline device
       00:Bo:52:BA:BE:01. The device will echo the frame about once per second for 5 seconds.

          # int6kecho -f abc.hex -d 5 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01
