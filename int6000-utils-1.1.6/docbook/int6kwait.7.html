int6kwait(7)                          Intellon Linux Toolkit                         int6kwait(7)

NAME
       int6kwait - Intellon INT6000 Procrastinator

SYNOPSIS
       int6kwait [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  Intellon  Event  Manager  polls  an  Intellon INT6x00 device, waiting for one or more
       events to occur before continuing or returning. The events include  reset  or  power  off,
       restart or power on and network association. It is used to pause shell scripts at critical
       points where a device must be in a known state before continuing.

       This program is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for  an  overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -a     Poll  the device every few seconds using VS_NW_INFO messages until the device indi‐
              cates that a networks exists and has at least one station.  This  option  can  give
              false readings if other devices have dropped off-line and the device bridging table
              still holds information about them. The program always checks for this  event  last
              if other event options are specified.

       -c count
              The  number  of  times  the  program will poll the device before declaring an event
              failure. The program will wait a fixed period of time between  each  poll  attempt.
              Overall  wait  time is count/frequency where count can be modified using option -c.
              Overall wait time is always approximate since operating system overhead and latency
              are not taken into account. The default count is 60.

       -e     Redirects  stderr  messages  to stdout. By convention status and error messages are
              printed on stderr while primary program output is printed on  stdout.  This  option
              prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -f firmware
              The  identification  string  for  firmware  that should be running after the device
              starts. This option can be used to detect a failed firmware  load.  If  the  actual
              identification  string does not match this one once the device starts then an error
              is reported. If option -x is present then the program terminates  with  a  non-zero
              exit code. This option has no effect unless option -s is present. An identification
              string looks like &quot;INT6000-MAC-3-1-3143-1690-20071107-FINAL-B&quot; and can be  obtained
              using int6k -r.

       -i     Select  the  host  Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this interface and
              only reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface  is
              eth1  because  most people use eth0 as their principle network connection; however,
              if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence  over  the  default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -p frequency
              The  polling frequency expressed in polls-per-second. For example, 1 means one poll
              per second and 10 means ten polls per second. Overall wait time is  count/frequency
              where  count  may be modified using option -c. Overall wait time is always approxi‐
              mate since operating system overhead and latency are not taken  into  account.  The
              default frequency is 5.

       -q     Enter quiet mode. Progress messages are suppressed.

       -r     Poll  the device every few seconds using VS_SW_VER messages until the bootloader or
              runtime firmware fails to respond or the poll count  exhausts.  The  absence  of  a
              response  indicates  that the device either lost connection to the host, lost power
              or has reset. The program always checks for this event first when other events  are
              specified.

       -R     Reset  the  device  then check return status. Exit program on error if option -x is
              present; otherwise, repeat the reset request until the device  either  accepts  the
              request or the wait time is exceeded.

       -s     Poll  the device every few seconds using VS_SW_VER messages until the bootloader or
              runtime firmware responds or the poll count exhausts. The presence  of  a  response
              indicates  that the device has either connected to the host, received power or fin‐
              ished reboot.

       -t     Display the actual time in seconds taken for successful completion, or  waited  for
              unsuccessful completion, of ecah event.

       -v     Enter  verbose  mode. All Etherenet frames sent or received by the program are dis‐
              played on stdout.

       -w seconds
              Additional time to wait once all events have occured. This wait does not  occur  if
              any of the events timeout. When no other events are specified this option is effec‐
              tively equivalent to sleep. This option can be used to allow the device or the net‐
              work  to settle. For example, a nominal 5 second wait is recommended after a device
              successfully associates before attempting to transfer data.

       -x     Exit program on first error with a non-zero exit code.  This  option  allows  shell
              scripts  to detect failed or incomplete operations and take the appropriate action.

       -?, --help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over  other
              options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print  program  version  information  on  stdout. This option takes precedence over
              other options on the command line. Use this option when  sending  screen  dumps  to
              Intellon  Technical  Support  so  that they know exactly which version of the Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The Media Access Control (MAC) address of some device. Addresses are 6  hexadecimal
              octets  optionally  separated  by colon. For example, the addresses &quot;00b052000001&quot;,
              &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are all valid and  equivalent.  For  conve‐
              nience,  the  symbolic address &quot;local&quot; resolves to &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and the sym‐
              bolic addresses &quot;all&quot; and &quot;broadcast&quot; both resolve to &quot;ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff&quot;.

EXAMPLES
       The following command polls the local device until firmware stops running then  polls  the
       device  until  firmware  starts  running  again. This command can be inserted into a shell
       script at a point where the device must reset and reboot before proceeding. Observer  that
       the  program waits up to 60 seconds for each event, in turn. The 60 seconds is the product
       of 60 poll attempts spaced 1 second apart.

          # int6kwait -rs
          eth0 00:B0:52:BA:BA:01 Allow 60 seconds for Reset
          eth0 00:B0:52:BA:BA:01 Allow 60 seconds for Start

       The following example specifies 5 poll attempts spaced 10  seconds  apart.  Less  frequent
       polling  reduces  network traffic but makes the program less responsive to events. Observe
       that the allotted time applies to each event in turn.

          # int6kwait -rs -p 10 -c 5
          eth0 00:B0:52:BA:BA:01 Allow 50 seconds for Reset
          eth0 00:B0:52:BA:BA:01 Allow 50 seconds for Start

       The next example reports the actual amount of time taken for each event to occur.  Observe
       that the last event, device association, did not occur within the allotted time.

          # int6kwait -rsat
          eth0 00:B0:52:BA:BA:01 Allow 60 seconds for Reset
          etho 00:B0:52:BA:BA:01 Waited 22 seconds to Reset
          eth0 00:B0:52:BA:BA:01 Allow 60 seconds for Start
          etho 00:B0:52:BA:BA:01 Waited 4 seconds to Start
          eth0 00:B0:52:BA:BA:01 Allow 60 seconds for Assoc
          etho 00:B0:52:BA:BA:01 Waited 60 seconds for Assoc
          etho 00:B0:52:BA:BA:01 Device did not Assoc

       The  following  example  illustrates  use  of  the  revision  string  to detect mismatched
       firmware. In this example, we reset the device first, using program int6k, then  wait  for
       it  to  reset  then  start up again. There are also operation that can cause the device to
       reset.

          # int6k -R
          # int6kwait -xrsf INT6000-MAC-3-1-3143-1690-20071107-FINAL-B
          eth0 00:B0:52:BA:BA:01 Device started wrong firmware

       Immediately after a reset we wait for the firmware to stop responding, with option -r, and
       then  start  responding,  with option -s, and then perform a string comparison against the
       actual firmware revision string, with option -f. If the strings do not match then an error
       is  reported. In this case, the program will exit with a non-zero return code since option
       -x is present.
