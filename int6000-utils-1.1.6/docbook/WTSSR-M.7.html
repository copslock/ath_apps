WTSSR-M(7)                            Intellon Linux Toolkit                           WTSSR-M(7)

NAME
       weeder - Weeder Solid State Relay Controller for Intellon PTS

SYNOPSIS
       This  man  page documents technical details about the the WTSSR-M Solid State Relay Module
       from Weeder Technology. Intellon uses two such modules to control a progammable attenuator
       in  their  Production  Test  System  and provides the weeder program in the Intellon Linux
       Toolkit. The information provided here goes beyond the capabilities of the weeder  program
       and is independent of any particular application.

       Relay modules can be chained. One module can be connected to an RS-232 port on a host com‐
       puter. Another module can be plugged into the first, a third into the second  and  so  on.
       This  allows multiple modules to be controlled via one serial port using text strings that
       address a specific device.

SWITCH SETTINGS
       Each Solid State Relay Module has a DIP switch that sets the module address. There are  16
       possible DIP switch configurations. The first character of each command string is an ASCII
       letter that corresponds to one of these configurations and, consequently, a specific  mod‐
       ule.

ACTIONS
       Modules can perform the following actions. Each action has a corresponding command that is
       described in the following secion.

       CLOSE  Closes the specified solid-state relay.  The relay  can  be  instructed  to  remain
              closed  until  a  further  command,  or  open back up after a user defined time-out
              period in the range of 1 to 65535 mS. For longer time-out values, use the  SEQUENCE
              command.  Note,  if  a time-out value is used, the communications port will be dis‐
              abled until the timing function has completed.

       OPEN   Opens the specified solid-state relay.  The relay can be instructed to remain  open
              until  a  further command, or close back up after a user defined time-out period in
              the range of 1 to 65535 mS. For longer time-out values, use the  SEQUENCE  command.
              Note,  if  a time-out value is used, the communications port will be disabled until
              the timing function has completed.

       READ   Reads the current state (open or closed) of a specified relay channel, or reads the
              current  state of all relay channels simultaneously as a 5-bit port in binary nota‐
              tion. If used as the latter, a five character ASCII string will be  returned  whose
              digits represent the open/close state of each relay channel.

       WRITE  Writes  data  to  all relay channels simultaneously as a 5-bit port in binary nota‐
              tion.  Data consists of a five character ASCII string whose  digits  represent  the
              open/close state of each relay channel.

       PAUSE  Loads  an  internal  timer  which  will  signal the host when the time interval has
              expired. Selectable range is from 1 to 65535 mS. This function is useful when time-
              derived operations or events must be executed without having to rely on timekeeping
              from the host.  Note, the communications port will be disabled until this  function
              has completed.

       SEQUENCE
              Loads  a  string  of  WRITE and PAUSE statements which will begin executing sequen‐
              tially. The event will commence immediately following the reception of the carriage
              return  which  terminates  the  command packet. The syntax for each WRITE and PAUSE
              statements should be the same as if using these commands separately, and should  be
              placed  end  to  end  with  no  separators between them.  Listed below is a typical
              sequence command string that will perform the following:

                 SW10000P60000W01000P5000W00100

              Close relay A, pause for 60 seconds, open relay A and close relay B,  pause  for  5
              seconds,  open  relay  B and close relay C. Note, if any syntax error exists within
              the sequence command string, the error symbol will be transmitted to the  host  and
              the sequence will not execute.

       DEFAULT
              Sets  the  default  state  (open or closed) of a specified relay channel which will
              then be loaded upon power-up or brown-out.

       ECHO   Turns on or off the confirmation echo which is used to verify reception of  a  com‐
              mand.   If reception confirmation is not needed, turning ECHO off will increase the
              repetitive rate at which the host can manipulate the relays.

       ERROR  ERROR - Any data string sent from the host containing the correct header  character
              but  an invalid command or variable will be responded to with this error indicator.

       RESET  Upon power-up or any other reset condition, this indicator is  transmitted  to  the
              host.  Note,  all  user configuration data is stored in non-volatile memory. There‐
              fore, a reset or loss of power will not corrupt these settings.

COMMANDS
       C relay timer
              Close relay for a period equal to timer where relay can be &quot;A&quot; or &quot;E&quot; and timer can
              be  1  to  65535in  milliseconds.  If  timer  is omitted then the relay will remain
              closed. (Note 3)

               Closes the specified solid-state relay. The relay  can  be  instructed  to  remain
              closed  until  a  further  command,  or  open back up after a user defined time-out
              period in the range of 1 to 65535 mS. For longer time-out values, use the  SEQUENCE
              command.  If  a  time-out  value  is used, the communications port will be disabled
              until the timing function has completed.

       O relay timer
              Open relay for a period equal to timer where relay can be &quot;A’ through &quot;E&quot; and timer
              can  be  1  to 65535 milliseconds. If timer is omitted then the relay remains open.
              (Note 3)

              Opens the specified solid-state relay.  The relay can be instructed to remain  open
              until  a  further command, or close back up after a user defined time-out period in
              the range of 1 to 65535 mS. For longer time-out values, use the  SEQUENCE  command.
              If  a  time-out  value  is used, the communications port will be disabled until the
              timing function has completed.

       R relay
              Read current state of relay. Returns relayC or relayO where relay is A-E, &quot;C&quot; means
              closed  and  &quot;O&quot;  means  open.  If  relay is omitted then reads relays &quot;relay C&quot; or
              &quot;relay O&quot;. relay = A-E C = closed, O = open. If relay omitted, read relays A-E as a
              5-bit port in binary notation. 1 = closed, 0 = open. Relay A = MSB.

              Reads the current state (open or closed) of a specified relay channel, or reads the
              current state of all relay channels simultaneously as a 5-bit port in binary  nota‐
              tion.  If  used as the latter, a five character ASCII string will be returned whose
              digits represent the open/close state of each relay channel.

       W state
              Write state to relays A-E as a 5-bit port in binary  notation  where  data  can  be
              00000 to 11111 such that 0 means open and 1 means closed. (Note 3)

              Writes  data  to  all relay channels simultaneously as a 5-bit port in binary nota‐
              tion. Data consists of a five character ASCII string  whose  digits  represent  the
              open/close state of each relay channel.

       P timer
              Loads an internal timer which will signal the host when expired.  time = 1 to 65535
              and is listed in milliseconds. When this function is complete,  the  &quot;P&quot;  character
              will be returned to the host.

       S string
              Loads  a  string  of  WRITE and PAUSE statements which will begin executing sequen‐
              tially. string may contain up to 110 characters. When this  function  is  complete,
              the &quot;S&quot; character will be returned to the host.

       D relay state
              Sets  the  default  state of a specific relay which will be loaded upon power-up or
              brown-out. The relay can be &quot;A&quot; through &quot;E&quot;. The state can be &quot;C&quot; or &quot;O&quot; where  &quot;C&quot;
              means &quot;closed&quot; and &quot;O&quot; means &quot;open&quot;. If the state is omitted the current setting is
              read. For example, &quot;DBC&quot; will set the default state of module B to closed.

       X value
              Turns on or off the reception confirmation echo. The value can be 0 or  1  where  0
              means  &quot;off&quot; and 1 means &quot;on&quot;. The dfault is 1. If value omitted, reads the current
              setting.

NOTES
       1)     All command strings sent to the data module should  be  preceded  with  the  header
              character  (see Table 1), and terminated with a carriage return. All responses from
              the data module will also appear in this format.

       2)     Any spaces shown above in the listing of the command strings are for clarity  only.
              They  should not be included in the actual transmission from the host, nor expected
              in a response from the data module.

       3)     If ECHO is on, after successful execution this command will be echoed back  to  the
              host in the same format as received.
