flashtest(7a)                         Intellon Linux Toolkit                        flashtest(7a)

NAME
       flashtest - NVRAM Diagnostic Applet

SYNOPSIS
       int6ktest flashtest.nvm [...]

PURPOSE
       This  diagnostic applet runs in TCM and performs a connectivity and data integrity test of
       onboard NVRAM. The test consists of the five  sub-tests  described  below.  Each  sub-test
       depends  on successful completion of the previous one. Progress and status messages appear
       on the local host console. Control returns to the Bootloader  and  NVRAM  is  left  in  an
       erased state on successful completion.

PREREQUISITES
       Bootloader software must be running. SDRAM need not be configured prior to execution.

SUBTESTS
       All  LEDs  will blink 6 times after each test passes and 9 times after all tests have com‐
       pleted successfully.

       1 - JDEC ID Test
              Read JEDEC ID and compare it to known compatible 2mb and 4mb NVRAMs. All LEDS  will
              flash on failure. Falure indicates an open or a short on any on the four SPI lines.
              This test completes quickly.

       2 - Bulk Erase
              Performs a bulk erase and verifies that all locations contain 0xFF. All  LEDs  will
              flash  on  failure.  Failure probably indicates a bad component. This test may take
              about 20 seconds to complete.

       3 - Write/Read Data Test
              Write the first 8 bytes of flash sector 0 with a floating 0 pattern and writes  the
              next  8  bytes  with a 1’s fill pattern. then read the patterns back. All LEDs will
              flash on failure. Failure indicates a bad NVRAM. This test completes quickly.

       4 - Read/Write Address Test
              Write the first location of the next 8 sectors with a progressive data  patternsuch
              that  the  first  location of sector 1 is written with 1 then the first location of
              sector 2 is written with 2 and so on. Data is read  and  verified.  All  LEDS  will
              flash on failure. Failure indicates a bad NVRAM. This test completes quickly.

       5 - Sector Erase Test
              Sequentially erase all sectors. After each sector is erased, confirm that remaining
              sectiors retain data. Failure indicates a bad NVRAM. This test takes about 10  sec‐
              onds to complete.

EXAMPLES
       The following example uses program int6ktest to download  and  execute  applet  memctl.nvm
       then  applet  flashtest.nvm  in order. Applet memctl.nvm configures SDRAM before executing
       flashtest.

          # int6ktest flashtest.nvm
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write Memory (00001000:4708)
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Wrote flashtest.nvm
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Start flashtest.nvm (0)
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 0x00 JEDEC ID: 0x202015
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 0x00 JEDEC ID test - Pass
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 0x00 Bulk Erase test - Pass
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 0x00 Write/Read Data test - Pass
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 0x00 Write/Read Addr test - Pass
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 0x00 Sector Erase test - Pass
