setpib(7)                             Intellon Linux Toolkit                            setpib(7)

NAME
       setpib - Intellon PIB File Editor

SYNOPSIS
       setpib file offset [format data] [format data] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Replace one or more values in a PIB file and re-compute the checksum. Values are specified
       as a sequence of type/data pairs. Users must know the offset, length and type of the  val‐
       ues they change or problems will certainly result. This program makes absolutely no effort
       to validate offsets or values.

       This program can be used to change any PIB value, including  those  that  one  should  not
       change. Be warned that some PIB values are derived from, or interact with, others. Failure
       to observe these dependencies may diminish performance or render the device inoperable.

       Intellon does not recommend the use of this program to edit PIB parameters  because  small
       mistakes  can  cause big problems. In addition, Intellon is under no obligation to provide
       customers with the offsets or types of PIB file parameters.

       Intellon recommends using program modpib to change common device identity  parameters.  It
       also recommends using the Windows Device Manager whenever possible.

       This  program  is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for an overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -q     Enable quiet mode which has not effect.

       -v     Print a hexdump of the edited region. Print hexdump headers if this option  appears
              twice. The region window may be changed with option -w.

       -w window
              The display window in bytes. When option -v is present, PIB information surrounding
              the edited region is displayed to provide some sort of context. The  edited  region
              appears  in  the  middle of this window. The default window is 32 bytes. This means
              that the 32 bytes before and the 32 bytes after the edited region are  included  in
              the display.

       -x     Repair  the  checksum. By default, this program will not modify files that fail the
              size or checksum test when opened. In addition, the program does not compute a  new
              checksum  unless  data has been changed. This option skips the the checksum test on
              before and indicates that data has changed after so that a  new  checksum  will  be
              computed.

       -?, --help
              Print  program  help  summary  on  stdout.  This option takes precedence over other
              options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over
              other  options  on  the  command  line. Usethis option when sending screen dumps to
              Intellon Technical Support so that they know exactly which  version  of  the  Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The  PIB  filename.  The file must exist and will be re-written. No assumptions are
              made based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced. This  argument  is
              required and must precede the base argument.

       offset The  byte  offset  where changes will start. The offset is expressed in hexadecimal
              with (or without) the leading &quot;0x&quot;. Changes are applied in order,  left  to  right,
              and  offset  automatically  increments  by  the correct amount after each change is
              applied. This permits consectuive PIB locations to be  changed  with  one  command.
              This  argument  is required and must follow the file argument. It must also precede
              all format/data pairs.

              Normally, you must use multiple setpib commands to change non-consecutive PIB loca‐
              tions but careful use of format skip can achive the same results using one command.

       format The implied length and encoding of the data. Valid types are byte, word, long, data
              and  hfid.  A valid format must precede each data item. A byte is 8 bits, a word is
              16 bits, a long is 32 bits and a huge is 64 bits. The format  implies  the  maximum
              data  value except for format data which is limited by the number of octets entered
              on the command line.

       data   The information written to the current PIB offset. Integer data may be expressed in
              binary,  decimal or hexadecimal but must not exceed the specified type. String data
              may contain any ASCII characters that can be  entered  via  keyboard  but  must  be
              enclosed  in quotes when spaces are included. Binary values start with 0b or 0B and
              hexadecimal values start with 0x or 0X.

FORMATS
       byte integer
              An unsigned integer stored as 8 bits or 1 byte. The value is expressed  in  decimal
              by  default  but a binary value may be expressed with a 0b prefix and a hexadecimal
              value may be expressed using a 0x prefix.  Offset will increment by 1.

       word integer
              An unsigned integer stored as 16 bits or 2 bytes. The value is expressed in decimal
              by  default  but a binary value may be expressed with a 0b prefix and a hexadecimal
              value may be expressed using a 0x prefix.  Offset will increment by 2.

       long integer
              An unsigned integer stored as 32 bits or 4 bytes. The value is expressed in decimal
              by  default  but a binary value may be expressed with a 0b prefix and a hexadecimal
              value may be expressed using a 0x prefix.  Offset will increment by 4.

       huge integer
              An unsigned integer stored as 64 bits or 8 bytes. The value is expressed in decimal
              by  default  but a binary value may be expressed with a 0b prefix and a hexadecimal
              value may be expressed using a 0x prefix.  Offset will increment by 8. This  format
              is only available on hosts that support 64 bit data values.

       data hex
              A stream of hexadecimal octets optionally separated by colons. The number of octets
              determines the number of bytes written. Offset will  increment  by  the  number  of
              bytes written. This is identical to &quot;hex&quot; below.

       hex hex
              A stream of hexadecimal octets optionally separated by colons. The number of octets
              determines the number of bytes written. Offset will  increment  by  the  number  of
              bytes written. This is identical to &quot;data&quot; above.

       hfid text
              An  ASCII  character string. The string is always stored as 64 bytes. Short strings
              are padded on the right with NUL characters. Long  strings  are  truncated  on  the
              right.  Offset  will  increment  by 64. This may be used to enter user, network and
              manufacturer identification strings.

       key hex
              A stream of hexadecimal octets optionally separated by colons. The number of octets
              must  convert to 16 bytes or an error will occur. Offset will increment by 16. This
              is similar &quot;data&quot; and &quot;hex&quot; above but demands fixed length input. It may be used to
              set the DAK, NMK or NVAK values.

       zero count
              An  unsigned  integer  representing  the  number of consecutive bytes to write with
              0x00. Offset will increment by the number of bytes written. This  may  be  used  to
              erase regions of the PIB.

       fill count
              An  unsigned  integer  representing  the  number of consecutive bytes to write with
              0xFF. Offset will increment by the number of bytes written. This  may  be  used  to
              erase regions of the PIB.

       skip count
              An  unsigned  integer  representing the number of consecutive bytes to skip over or
              advance before applying  the  next  change.  The  intervening  data  locations  are
              unchanged.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example  edits  PIB file abc.pib by writing decimal value 1 at offset 01F7
       followed by hexadecimal value 00B052BABE01. A partial dump is  printed  showing  16  bytes
       before and after the edited data. The dump can be suppressed with option -q.

          # setpib -v abc.pib 01F7 byte 1 data 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01
          000001D0                       00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00         .........

       The  following  example  sets  the  manufacturer HFID string of a PIB. HFID strings are 64
       characters long and either truncated or padded on the right with NUL characters.  You  may
       need to enclose the string in quotes it it contains spaces.

       The following example displays the contents of file abc.pib without changing any data. The
       region displayed is 24 bytes starting at offset 0x24. The format skip specified  a  region
       without  changing  it.  By default, the 32 bytes before and 32 bytes after are included in
       the display.

       The following example computes a new checksum without changing data. The file name  and  a
       valid  offset are required but no other values are needed. This form of the command can be
       used after modifying the PIB using software that does not update the checksum.

          # setpib abc.pib 0 -x
