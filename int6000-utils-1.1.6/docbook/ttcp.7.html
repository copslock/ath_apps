TTCP(7)                                                                                   TTCP(7)

NAME
       ttcp - test TCP and UDP performance

SYNOPSIS
       ttcp  -t  [-u]  [-s]  [-p port]  [-l buflen] [-b size] [-n numbufs] [-A align] [-O offset]
       [-f format] [-D] [-v] host [&lt;in]
       ttcp -r [-u] [-s] [-p port] [-l buflen] [-b size] [-A align] [-O offset] [-f format]  [-B]
       [-T] [-v] [&gt;out]

DESCRIPTION
       Ttcp times the transmission and reception of data between two systems using the UDP or TCP
       protocols.  It differs from common ‘‘blast’’ tests, which tend to measure the remote inetd
       as  much  as  the  network performance, and which usually do not allow measurements at the
       remote end of a UDP transmission.

       For testing, the transmitter should be started with -t and -s after the receiver has  been
       started  with  -r and -s.  Tests lasting at least tens of seconds should be used to obtain
       accurate measurements.  Graphical presentations  of  throughput  versus  buffer  size  for
       buffers ranging from tens of bytes to several ‘‘pages’’ can illuminate bottlenecks.

       Ttcp  can also be used as a ‘‘network pipe’’ for moving directory hierarchies between sys‐
       tems when routing problems exist or when the use of other mechanisms is  undesirable.  For
       example, on the destination machine, use: ttcp -r -B | tar xvpf -

       and on the source machine: tar cf - directory | ttcp -t dest_machine

       Additional intermediate machines can be included by: ttcp -r | ttcp -t next_machine

OPTIONS
       -t        Transmit mode.

       -r        Receive mode.

       -u        Use UDP instead of TCP.

       -s        If  transmitting, source a data pattern to network; if receiving, sink (discard)
                 the data.  Without the -s option, the default is to transmit data from stdin  or
                 print the received data to stdout.

       -l length Length of buffers in bytes (default 8192).  For UDP, this value is the number of
                 data bytes in each packet.  The system limits the  maximum  UDP  packet  length.
                 This limit can be changed with the -b option.

       -b size   Set  size  of  socket  buffer.   The default varies from system to system.  This
                 parameter affects the maximum UDP packet length.  It may not be possible to  set
                 this parameter on some systems (for example, 4.2BSD).

       -n numbufs
                 Number of source buffers transmitted (default 2048).

       -p port   Port  number to send to or listen on (default 2000).  On some systems, this port
                 may be allocated to another network daemon.

       -D        If transmitting using TCP, do not buffer data when sending (sets the TCP_NODELAY
                 socket  option).   It  may not be possible to set this parameter on some systems
                 (for example, 4.2BSD).

       -B        When receiving data, output only full blocks, using the block size specified  by
                 -l.   This  option is useful for programs, such as tar(1), that require complete
                 blocks.

       -A align  Align the start of buffers to this modulus (default 16384).

       -O offset Align the start of buffers to this offset (default 0).   For  example,  ‘‘-A8192
                 -O1’’ causes buffers to start at the second byte of an 8192-byte page.

       -f format Specify,  using  one  of  the following characters, the format of the throughput
                 rates  as  kilobits/sec  (’k’),   kilobytes/sec   (’K’),   megabits/sec   (’m’),
                 megabytes/sec (’M’), gigabits/sec (’g’), or gigabytes/sec (’G’).  The default is
                 ’K’.

       -T        ‘‘Touch’’ the data as they are read in order to measure cache effects.

       -v        Verbose: print more statistics.

       -d        Debug: set the SO_DEBUG socket option.
