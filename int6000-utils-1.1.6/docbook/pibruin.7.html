pibruin(7)                            Intellon Linux Toolkit                           pibruin(7)

NAME
       pibruin - Classification Rule Insert Utility

SYNOPSIS
       pibruin [options] [&lt;rules] file

DESCRIPTION
       Read  a  set  of classification rules from stdin and insert them directly into a PIB file.
       This program is an alternative to program int6krule and a companion  to  program  pibrump.
       Although  it  is  possible  to  ruin a PIB using this command, the name is short for &quot;rule
       insert&quot;.

       Intellon recommends that users validate all classification rule sets used with  this  pro‚Äê
       gram  before inserting them into an operational PIB. Individual rules may be syntactically
       valid but they can still be technically invalid or conflict with other. This program  does
       not perform any technical or cross-rule validation what-so-ever.

       Cross-rule  validation  is  normally  done  by  runtime  firmware when a rule arrives in a
       VS_CLASSIFIER management message. This validation prevents the insertion of meaningless or
       conflicting  rules into the PIB. It may be possible to commit a PIB containing mis-config‚Äê
       ured classification rule sets thus causing the device to lockup or misbehave on reboot.

       One recommended method of rule set validation is to program a device with individual rules
       using  program  int6krule then read the PIB and extract the rule set with program pibrump.
       The rule set should be valid at that point.

       This program is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for  an  overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -q     Suppresses progress messages.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Print  program  help  summary  on  stdout.  This option takes precedence over other
              options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over
              other  options  on  the  command  line. Usethis option when sending screen dumps to
              Intellon Technical Support so that they know exactly which  version  of  the  Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The  name  of a valid Intellon runtime parameter file. The file is modified by this
              program only if the classification rule file is syntactically correct. See the DIS‚Ä‚Äê
              CLAIMER  section below. No backup file is created. By convention, runtime parameter
              files have a .pib extention but this program does not enforce that convention.  The
              file must exist and be a valid PIB file or errors will occur.

       rules  The name of a valid classifier rule file. The file is not modified by this program.
              Classifier rule files are standard ASCII text and may be created manually  using  a
              normal  text editor or may be generated automatically using another program such as
              pubrump. By convention, classifier rule files have a ..qos extension but this  pro‚Äê
              gram  does not enforce that convention. If this file is omitted then rules are read
              from from the console, one rule per line.

DISCLAIMER
       PIB file structure and content is proprietary to Intellon Corporation, Ocala FL USA.  Con‚Äê
       sequently, public information is not available. Intellon Corporation reserves the right to
       change the file structure or content in future firmware releases without any obligation to
       notify or compensate users of this program.

       This  program  is  provided  for convenience only. It is possible to insert meaningless or
       confilicting rule sets into a PIB with this program because approved cross-rule validation
       is not performed. Incorrect application of perfectly valid rules may render a device inef‚Äê
       fective or unusable on a powerline network. Program users  are  responsible  for  ensuring
       that  their rule sets are verified by other means before using this program to insert them
       into an operational PIB file.

EXAMPLES
       The following is an example set of classification rules stored in file rules.txt. The file
       contains  5  rules,  one  rule per line. The rules are identical to command line arguments
       expected by program int6krule and one could type them, one at a time, into  int6krule  and
       wait  for  the  device  to  reset  each  time.  Alternately, we could insert all the rules
       directly into a PIB file at once then download and commit the PIB, resulting in  only  one
       reset.

          &gt; cat rules.txt
          Cap1 any VLANID is 20 add perm
          DropRX any VLANID is 25 add perm
          StripRx any VLANID is 5 VLANID is 10 VLANID is 15 add perm
          StripRx any VLANID is 20 add perm
          Cap1 any VLANID is 5 VLANID is 10 VLANID is 15 add perm

       The  following  example  reads  file rules.txt from stdin and writes it into file def.pib.
       This may be usefule if one wanted to distribute a known set of rules  to  other  users  or
       wanted to test various combinations of rules. Sincd rule files are

          &gt; pibruin &lt; rules.txt

       The  next  example  reads  classification  rules  directly from file abc.pib using program
       pibrump and writes them directly into file def.pbi using  program  pibruin.  This  is  one
       means of transfering classification rules from one PIB to another.
