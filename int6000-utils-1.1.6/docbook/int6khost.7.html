int6khost(7)                          Intellon Linux Toolkit                         int6khost(7)

NAME
       int6khost - INT6300 Host Emulator

SYNOPSIS
       int6khost [options] -C file -N file -P file -n file -p file

DESCRIPTION
       The  INT6300  Host  Emulator  waits for VS_HST_ACTION.IND messages from a local device and
       services them as described in the INT6300 Technical Reference Manual. It can  be  used  to
       demonstrate  or verify proper device/host interaction for flash-less devices. This program
       is not production grade and will stop dead - like a bug! - when things go wrong.  Use  the
       Intellon Embedded API for real-time, production-grade applications.

       Host  emulation applies to flash-less device designs where a local host processor provides
       the persistent storage. The local host can provide a wide  range  of  intelligent  storage
       functions  for  a  device but this program offers one. Options -C, -N and -P name existing
       files that store factory default memory configuration, runtime  firmware  and  parameters,
       respectively.  Options  -n  and  -p  name  scratch files that will store user firmware and
       parameters, respectively.This is similiar to the standard Intellon NVRAM scheme but  still
       different.

       To  use  the program, connect a flash-less device to the host via ethernet then start this
       program with the correct filenames. The  program  will  automatically  respond  to  device
       requests  to download memory configuration, firmware and/or parameters and upload firmware
       or and/or parameters under device control. See the Intellon Firmware  Technical  Reference
       Manual for more information.

       This  program  is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for an overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -C filename
              Use this file to download memory configuration when requested by the local  device.
              The  file  must  exist  and  have  a  valid configuration file format or it will be
              rejected. No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are
              enforced.  The  program will not over-write this file. This option and argument are
              required.

       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout. By convention status and  error  messages  are
              printed  on  stderr  while primary program output is printed on stdout. This option
              prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -F[F]  Flash NVRAM once downloaded firmware has started. The same  firmware  and  PIB  are
              downloaded,  again, using VS_WR_MOD and written to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM. Adding a
              second F here or another -F anywhere on the command  line  will  perform  a  forced
              flash.  When no NVRAM is present, normal and force flash cause the device to upload
              to the host. When blank or corrupted NVRAM  is  present,  forced  flash  writes  to
              NVRAM. This operation will fail when no NVRAM is present.

       -i interface
              Select  the  host  Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this interface and
              only reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface  is
              eth1  because  most people use eth0 as their principle network connection; however,
              if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence  over  the  default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -N filename
              Use  this  file  to  download firmware when requested by the local device. The file
              must exist and have a valid NVM file format or it will be rejected. No  assumptions
              are  made  based  on filename and no filename conventions are enforced. The program
              will not over-write this file. This option and argument are required.

       -n filename
              Use this file to store firmware uploaded from the local device. The file  need  not
              exist  but  an  error will occur if it cannot be created or written. If firmware is
              uploaded to this file, it is used for  subsequent  firmware  downloads  unless  the
              device  requests  a factory reset. In that case, the file specified by option -N is
              used. This option and argument are optional. If omitted then the  default  filename
              host.pib will be used.

       -P filename
              Use  this  file to download parameters when requested by the local device. The file
              must exist and have a valid PIB file format or it will be rejected. No  assumptions
              are  made  based  on filename and no filename conventions are enforced. The program
              will not over-write this file. This option and argument are required.

       -p filename
              Use this file to store parameters uploaded from the local device. The file need not
              exist  but  an error will occur if it cannot be created or written. Once parameters
              are uploaded to this file, it is used for subsequent parameter downloads unless the
              device  requests  a factory reset. In that case, the file specified by option -P is
              used. This option and argument are optional. If omitted then the  default  filename
              host.nvm will be used.

       -q     Suppress status messages on stderr.

       -v     Print  additional  information  on  stdout.  In  particular, this option will print
              incoming and outgoing Ethernet frames on stdout.

       -?, --help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over  other
              options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print  program  version  information  on  stdout. This option takes precedence over
              other options on the command line. Use this option when  sending  screen  dumps  to
              Intellon  Technical  Support  so  that they know exactly which version of the Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       None.

EXAMPLES
       The following command starts the host emulator. The -C,  -N  and  -P  options  are  always
       required. Their order is not important.

          int6khost -C test.cfg -N test.nvm -P test.pib
