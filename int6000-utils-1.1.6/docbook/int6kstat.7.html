int6kstat(7)                          Intellon Linux Toolkit                         int6kstat(7)

NAME
       int6kstat - Intellon Device Statistics Utility

SYNOPSIS
       int6kstat [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  Intellon Device Statistics Utility polls a device and prints network and link statis‐
       tics in various formats suitable for use by other programs. This is a work in progress  so
       usr feedback is encouraged.

       This  program  is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for an overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -d direction
              Returns statistics in the specified direction using VS_LNK_STATS. Direction can  be
              0=tx, 1=rx, 2=both or &quot;rx&quot;, &quot;tx&quot; or &quot;both&quot;.

       -e     Redirects  stderr  messages  to stdout. By convention status and error messages are
              printed on stderr while primary program output is printed on  stdout.  This  option
              prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i     Select  the  host  Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this interface and
              only reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface  is
              eth1  because  most people use eth0 as their principle network connection; however,
              if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence  over  the  default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -l count
              Define the number of times that the command will be repeated for each device speci‐
              fied. Normally, you will repeat operations on one device only.

       -m     Displays network membership information, as seen by one device,  using  VS_NW_INFO.
              Use option -t for complete network topology seen by the local host.

       -p peernode
              Ethernet    hardware    address   of   the   peer   node   for   VS_LNK_STATS   and
              VS_RX_TONE_MAP_CHAR. A peer node MAC address is required for all VS_LNK_STATS  Link
              ID  values  except  0xFC.  It is also required for VS_RX_TONE_MAP_CHAR. The default
              address is 00:00:00:00:00:00.

       -q     Enter quiet mode. Progress messages are suppressed.

       -s linkid
              The Link ID for VS_LNK_STATS. Link ID values range from 0 through 255 but  not  all
              values  are  accepted  by  the device firmware. Values may be expressed in decimal,
              binary prefixed with &quot;0b&quot; or hexadecimal prefixed by &quot;0x&quot;. Many valid values can be
              expressed  by name. Valid values are listed and explained under LINKID. The default
              Link ID is 0xFC.

       -t     Display network  topology  using  seen  by  the  local  host  using  VS_SW_VER  and
              VS_NW_INFO  messages.  This  is  similar to option -m but provides complete network
              topology plus device hardware and firmware version.

       -v     Enter verbose mode. All Etherenet frames sent or received by the program  are  dis‐
              played on stdout.

       -w seconds
              Defines  the  number of seconds to wait before repeating command line options. This
              option has no effect unless option -l is also specified with a non-zero value.

       -?, --help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over  other
              options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print  program  version  information  on  stdout. This option takes precedence over
              other options on the command line. Use this option when  sending  screen  dumps  to
              Intellon  Technical  Support  so  that they know exactly which version of the Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The MAC address of some powerline device. More than one address may  be  specified.
              If  more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device
              in turn. The default address is local. See DEVICES for information  about  symbolic
              device addresses.

LINKID
       0x00,CSMA-CAP0
              Display  CSMA  statistics  for CAP0 traffic using a single peer node. The peer node
              MAC address must be specified using option -p.

       0x01,CSMA-CAP1
              Display CSMA statistics for CAP1 traffic using a single peer node.  The  peer  node
              MAC address must be specified using option -p.

       0x02,CSMA-CAP2
              Display  CSMA  statistics  for CAP2 traffic using a single peer node. The peer node
              MAC address must be specified using option -p.

       0x03,CSMA-CAP3
              Display CSMA statistics for CAP3 traffic using a single peer node.  The  peer  node
              MAC address must be specified using option -p.

       0xF8,CSMA-PEER
              Display  CSMA  statistics  for all traffic using a single  peer node. The peer node
              MAC address must be specified using option -p.

       0xFC,CSMA-ALL
              Display CSMA statistics for all traffic with  all  peer  nodes.  A  peer  node  MAC
              address  is  not  needed and will be ignored if provided. This value is the default
              for option -s.

DEVICES
       Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. A MAC  address  is  a
       48-bit  value  entered  as  12 hexadecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.
       Octets  may  be  separated  with  colons  for  clarity.   For   example,   &quot;00b052000001&quot;,
       &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A  synonym  for  the  Ethernet  broadcast  address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. All devices,
              whether local, remote or foreign recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote
              device  is any device at the far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device is
              any device not manufactured by Intellon.

       local  A synonym  for  the  Intellon  vendor  specific  Local  Management  Address  (LMA),
              00:B0:52:00:00:01. All local Intellon devices recognize this address but remote and
              foreign devices do not. A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline
              connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Intellon.
