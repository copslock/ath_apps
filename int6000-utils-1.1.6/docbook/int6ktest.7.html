int6ktest(7)                          Intellon Linux Toolkit                         int6ktest(7)

NAME
       int6ktest - Intellon Test Applet Loader

SYNOPSIS
       int6ktest [options] [file] [file] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Download and execute one or more test applets on the local powerline. An applet is a small
       firmware image that can be started by the bootloader and that returns  to  the  bootloader
       when done.

       An  Intellon image file can contain one or more firmware images. Each image is preceded by
       a header that specifies the image size, load address and start address. int6ktest  sequen‐
       tially  dowloads  and  executes each image found in each image file specified as a command
       line argument. It waits for each image to complete before it will download and execute the
       next  image.  The program terminates once all images in all image files have been executed
       or some image fails to complete within 60 seconds.

       Most applets return to the Bootloader on successful completion so that another applet  can
       be  downloaded and executed. This allows applet chains to be executed using one command. A
       chain may consist of one image file containing many applets or several  image  files  con‐
       taining  one applet each or any combination. The chain will break, after a timeout, if any
       applet in the chain fails to return to the Bootloader.

       The toolkit contains a set of useful applets in folder applets. Most, if not all,  are  as
       single  applet image files. Program chknvm can be used to inspect image files and programs
       nvmmerge and nvmsplit can be used to assemble and disassemble  multi-applet  image  files.
       This  allows  custom applet chains to be created and kept together in one file. The number
       and quality of available applets will probably increase with time.

       Users should take the time to understand the applets they attempt to execute or  confusion
       may result. Each applet should have an associated man page to explain what it does and how
       it works. Most applets execute and return to the bootloader within seconds but  some  loop
       indefinitely  or  stop  on  failure. Newer applets print test progress and outcomes on the
       console but older applets merely flash device LEDs to indicate test progress and outcomes.

       This  program  is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for an overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -c count
              The number of times the program will poll the  device  before  declaring  an  event
              failure.  The  program  will wait a fixed period of time between each poll attempt.
              Overall wait time is count/frequency where count can be modified using  option  -c.
              Overall wait time is always approximate since operating system overhead and latency
              are not taken into account. The default count is 60.

       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout. By convention status and  error  messages  are
              printed  on  stderr  while primary program output is printed on stdout. This option
              prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i interface
              Select the host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via  this  interface  and
              only  reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface is
              eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle network  connection;  however,
              if  environment  string  &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -p frequency
              The polling frequency expressed in polls-per-second. For example, 1 means one  poll
              per  second and 10 means ten polls per second. Overall wait time is count/frequency
              where count  may  be  modified  using  option  -c.  Overall  wait  time  is  always
              approximate since operating system overhead and latency are not taken into account.
              The default frequency is 5.

       -q     Suppresses normal progress and status messages.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout. Specifically, this option  prints  incoming
              and  outgoing  frames  in hexadecimal format on stdout. Output can be directed to a
              text file for analysis.

       -x     Cause the program to exit on the first error instead  of  moving  on  to  the  next
              applet. Error exits return a non-zero value to the shell.

       -?, --help
              Print  program  help  summary  on  stdout.  This option takes precedence over other
              options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over
              other  options  on  the  command line. Use this option when sending screen dumps to
              Intellon Technical Support so that they know exactly which  version  of  the  Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The  name of an Intellon image file. The image file may contain one or more images.
              Each image will be downloaded and executed in turn until all images are executed or
              an  image  fails to return the device to the Bootloader within 1 hour for some rea‐
              son.

EXAMPLES
       The following example sequentially downloads then executes each image in file  abc.nvm  in
       turn. Each image must complete and return to the bootloader before the next one downloadd.
       Observe that no device address is needed because all use address 00:b0:52:00:00:01 when in
       bootloader mode.

          # int6ktest abc.nvm

       The  following  example  will  sequentially  download  and execute the images in each file
       abc.nvm, def.nvm and ghi.nvm in turn.

          # int6ktest abc.nvm def.nvm ghi.nvm
