int6kprobe(7)                         Intellon Linux Toolkit                        int6kprobe(7)

NAME
       int6kprobe - Intellon Diagnostic Network Probe

SYNOPSIS
       int6kprobe [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       None.

       This  program  is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for an overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -c     Clear counters after read.

       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout. By convention status and  error  messages  are
              printed  on  stderr  while primary program output is printed on stdout. This option
              prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i interface
              Select the host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via  this  interface  and
              only  reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface is
              eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle network  connection;  however,
              if  environment  string  &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout. In particular, this option  dumps  incoming
              and outgoing packets which can be saved as text files for reference.

       -?,--help
              Print  program  help  summary  on  stdout.  This option takes precedence over other
              options on the command line.

       -?,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over
              other  options  on  the  command line. Use this option when sending screen dumps to
              Intellon Technical Support so that they know exactly which  version  of  the  Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The  MAC  address of some powerline device. More than one address may be specified.
              If more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each  device
              in  turn.  The default address is local. See DEVICES for information about symbolic
              device addresses.

DEVICES
       Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. A MAC  address  is  a
       48-bit  value  entered  as  12 hexadecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.
       Octets  may  be  separated  with  colons  for  clarity.   For   example,   &quot;00b052000001&quot;,
       &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A  synonym  for  the  Ethernet  broadcast  address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. All devices,
              whether local, remote or foreign recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote
              device  is any device at the far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device is
              any device not manufactured by Intellon.

       local  A synonym  for  the  Intellon  vendor  specific  Local  Management  Address  (LMA),
              00:B0:52:00:00:01. All local Intellon devices recognize this address but remote and
              foreign devices do not. A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline
              connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Intellon.
