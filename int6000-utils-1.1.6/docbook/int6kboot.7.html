int6kboot(7)                          Intellon Linux Toolkit                         int6kboot(7)

NAME
       int6kboot - Intellon Boot Utility

SYNOPSIS
       int6kboot [options] -N file -P file

DESCRIPTION
       Download  and start runtime firmware on a local Intellon powerline device that is in boot‐
       loader mode. A device stays in bootloader mode when it cannot load  firmware  from  NVRAM.
       That  can happen because there is no NVRAM or because the NVRAM is blank or corrupted. The
       bootloader only understands a subset of Intellon message types  and  cannot  flash  NVRAM.
       This  program  uses  that subset to download runtime firmware and start execution. Option‐
       ally, it will proceed to flash NVRAM after the firmware has started.

       Booting a device is a two part operation. The first part downloads an SDRAM  configuration
       program  into  TCM  and executes it then it downloads runtime firmware and parameters into
       SDRAM and starts the firmware. The second part downloads runtime  firmare  and  parameters
       (again)  into scratch buffers and instructs the firmware to write them into to NVRAM. This
       program can perform the first part alone or the first then the second  part  but  not  the
       second part alone. The second part can be performed alone using program int6k.

       This  program  is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for an overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout. By convention status and  error  messages  are
              printed  on  stderr  while primary program output is printed on stdout. This option
              prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -F[F]  Write previously downloaded MAC and PIB to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM. Adding a  second
              F  here or another -F anywhere on the command line will force-flash a blank or cor‐
              rupted NVRAM. Firmware loaded from NVRAM will treat force-flash as an  error.  This
              option  can  be  used  to create factory settings but cannot be used to change them
              once created. Subsequent use creates and updates operational settings that  can  be
              erased  using a factory reset. This option is executed after all others on the com‐
              mand line, except for the -R option.

       -i interface
              Select the host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via  this  interface  and
              only  reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface is
              eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle network  connection;  however,
              if  environment  string  &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -N filename
              Read the named NVM file and write it to the device. This option  and  argument  are
              required.  Any  file having an invalid NVM file format will be rejected. No assump‐
              tions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced.

       -P filename
              Read the named PIB file and write it to the device. This option  and  argument  are
              required.  Any  file having an invalid PIB file format will be rejected. No assump‐
              tions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -t timer
              Read timeout or capture period in milliseconds. This value has different effects on
              Linux and Windows. On Linux, where native raw sockets are used, this is the maximum
              time allowed for a response and so larger values should not affect performance.  On
              Windows, where WinPcap is used, this is the time allotted for packet capture and so
              larger values will certainly affect performance. The default is 50 milliseconds.

       -v     Prints additional information on stdout. In particular, this option dumps  outgoing
              Ethernet packets on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Print  program  help  summary  on  stdout.  This option takes precedence over other
              options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over
              other  options  on  the  command line. Use this option when sending screen dumps to
              Intellon Technical Support so that they know exactly which  version  of  the  Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       None.

EXAMPLES
       The  -N  and  -P options are always required. Their order is not important. Notice that no
       MAC address is needed because devices always use address  00:B0:52:00:00:01  (the  program
       default  address) when in bootloader mode. Once this operation completes, firmware is run‐
       ning in SDRAM but the NVRAM, if present, has not been programmed. This operation is common
       for  flash-less  devices. If we reset the device at this point then the device will return
       to bootloader mode.

          int6kbootp -N test.nvm -P test.pib
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write SDRAM Configuration
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Start Firmware
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Started.

       The next example does the same as the last example but performs extra steps needed to pro‐
       gram  NVRAM.  It  first  downloads the firmware image from file test.nvm and the parameter
       block image from file  test.pib  using  VS_WR_MEM  and  starts  firmware  execution  using
       VS_ST_MAC.  Once  runtime  firmware  has started, it downloads the same firmware image and
       parameter block image using VS_WR_MOD and commits them to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM.

          int6kbootp -N test.nvm -P test.pib -F
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write SDRAM Configuration
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Start Firmware
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Started.
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write MAC as module
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write PIB as module
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Flash Device
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Flashed.
