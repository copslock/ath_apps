NAME
       Intellon Applets

SYNOPSIS
       int6ktest applet [applet] [...]

APPLETS
       Applets  are small programs written for Intellon powerline devices and distributed as sin‚Äê
       gle-image .nvm files. The toolkit applets folder contains some useful applets having vari‚Äê
       ous purposes. See section CONFIGURATION, DIAGNOSTICS and SCOPE-LOOPS for brief inforamtion
       about some applets.

       Program int6ktest is used to download and execute applets from the command  line.  Program
       nvmmerge can be used to combine applets into applet chains for convenience or distribution
       to third parties. Program nvmsplit can be used to disassemble applet chains.

CONFIGURATION
       Configuration applets place a powerline device in a known state. They run once and  return
       to  the  bootloader  in a matter of seconds without indication. Some configuration applets
       are:

       memctl Runs in TCM and initializes the SDRAM controller on INT6300  and  INT6400  devices.
              This  applet  should be executed before applets that execute in SDRAM. If in doubt,
              run it.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Diagnostic applets explore a powerline device looking for abnormal  conditions.  They  run
       once  and  return  to  the  bootloader after giving some indication of success or failure.
       Older diagnostic applets flash device LEDs to indicate progress or  outcomes.  Newer  ones
       print console messages on the local host, instead. Some diagnostic applets are:

       connection
              Runs  in  TCM  and  checks  physical  onboard connections. This should be the first
              applet executed on a new device.

       flashtest
              Runs in TCM and checks NVRAM and associated onboard connections. Returns  to  boot‚Äê
              loader and Leaves NVRAM in an erased state on successful completion.

       linesynctest
              Runs  in  SDRAM  and  checks onboard zero-cross detection circuitry and reports the
              powerline frequecy. Progress and status messages appear on the local host  console.

       marchloop
              Runs  in  TCM  and checks SDRAM address lines, data lines and memory cells using an
              industry standard March2 memory test sequence. Progress and error message appear on
              the local host console.

       sdramtest
              Runs  in  TC and performs basic, slow-speed (160ns) SDRAM tests. If this diagnostic
              fails then most others will probably fail, as well.

SCOPE-LOOPS
       Scope-loop applets continuously exercise the device so that  engineers  can  study  device
       behavior  using  external  test equipment. Once started, scope-loops do not stop until the
       device is reset. Some scope-loop applets are:

       burstadrinadrtestloop
              Writes the address of each memory location into that location then reads each loca‚Äê
              tion looking for errors.

       burstreadtest6400
              Reads all of SDRAM in burst mode.

       burstwrite6400
              Writes all of SDRAM in burst mode.

       burstwritereadtest6400
              Writes then reads all of SDRAM in burst mode.
