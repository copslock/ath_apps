nvmmerge(7)                           Intellon Linux Toolkit                          nvmmerge(7)

NAME
       nvmmerge - Intellon Image File Splicer

SYNOPSIS
       nvmmerge [options] file [file] [...]  [&gt;stdout]

DESCRIPTION
       Combine Intellon image files leaving the original files intact.

       Intellon image files consist of a chain of image headers, each followed by an image block.
       Image blocks can contain data, applets or programs. Intellon  software  reads  the  header
       chain and decides which images to download and execute based on information in image head‐
       ers. Tampering with image headers or images may void some contractual obligations made  by
       Intellon.

       This  program  is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for an overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -q     Suppresses printing of routine messages. This option has no efect.

       -v     Print input file names on stderr as they are merged.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over  other
              options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print  program  version  information  on  stdout. This option takes precedence over
              other options on the command line. Usethis option  when  sending  screen  dumps  to
              Intellon  Technical  Support  so  that they know exactly which version of the Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The name of an Intellon image file. By convention, Intellon image files have a .nvm
              file  extension  but  this  program  does not enforce this convention. Invalid mage
              files will be rejected causing the output to be incomplete.

EXAMPLES
       The following example combines three files, abc-00.nvm, abc-01.nvm and abc-06.nvm into one
       file  abc.nvm. Option -v displays the input file names. Program output is in binary format
       and so output should be directed to a file or pipe and not the console.

          # nvmmerge -v abc-00.nvm abc-01.nvm abc-06.nvm &gt; abc.nvm
          nvmmerge: abc-00.nvm
          nvmmerge: abc-01.nvm
          nvmmerge: abc-06.nvm
