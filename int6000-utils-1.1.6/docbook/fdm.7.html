fdm(7)                                Intellon Linux Toolkit                               fdm(7)

NAME
       fdm - PIB Notching Script

SYNOPSIS
       fdm.sh [mode]

DESCRIPTION
       A script to program an Intellon HomePlug AV Powerline Device with a known set of prescalar
       values. Prescalar values tell runtime firware to attenuate or  ignore  specific  powerline
       frequencies. Prescalar sets are provided by Intellon as files that may be selected by num‐
       ber from a menu printed by this script. This number is called the notching mode.

       The script will read a device PIB into a temporary file, replace the  prescalars  in  that
       file, write that file back to the device and commit it to NVRAM. The script and associated
       prescalar files are all needed for proper operation. Users may edit  script  variables  or
       modify script logic to suit their requirements.

       This  program  is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for an overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       None.

ARGUMENTS
       mode   The notching mode. Mode values are listed in the script menu. Each mode corresponds
              to  a prescalar file that will be used to modify the device PIB using program psin.
              If omitted, a mode menu will be displayed an no action will occur.

FILES
       fdm.sh A Linux bash version of fdm.bat. Users should edit script paramters  ETH,  DIR  and
              DEV,  as  explained  below,  before running this script. The Intellon Linux Toolkit
              must be installed for proper script execution.

       fdm.bat
              A Microsoft DOS version of fdm.sh.  Users should edit script paramters ETH, DIR and
              DEV,  as  explained  below,  before running this script. The Intellon Linux Toolkit
              must be installed for proper script execution.

       scripts/prescaler
              A folder containing prescalar files. There is one prescalar file for each  notching
              mode.  All  files  must  reside in folder DIR as defined in the script file. If you
              change file names then you must also edit both script files to relfect that change.

VARIABLES
       There  are four variables defined at the start of the script. These variables permit relo‐
       cation of the script and/or the prescalar files.

       ETH    The name or the number of the host network interface used to communicate  with  the
              powerline  device.   On  Linux, the name will typicall be &quot;eth0&quot; or &quot;eth1&quot;. On Win‐
              dows, the number will typically be 2 or 3. This variable is expanded and passed  to
              toolkit programs using option -i.

       DIR    The  absolute  or  relative  path  of  the  folder  containing the prescalar files.
              Prescalar files are located in toolkit folder scripts/prescalers. You may move them
              to  another folder but must edit this variable so that they can be located when the
              script is executed.

       PIB    The temporary PIB filename. This file holds the PIB read from a device while it  is
              being  modified. Make sure that this filename does not conflict with other files by
              the same name.

       DEV    The hardware address of the powerline device to be modified. You  can  use  keyword
              local  which  translates  to  the  Local  Management Address (00:B0:52:00:00:01) or
              specify the actual MAC address of a remote powerline device.

EXAMPLES
       To display available modes, type the script filename but omit the mode argument. Available
       modes are listed along with the corresponding range of frequencies to be notched.

          # fdm.sh

          Intellon fdm mode utility

          usage: fdm mode

          mode = &quot;1&quot; 2.01MHz to 27.90Mhz w/HAM bands notched
          mode = &quot;2&quot; 2.01Mhz to 7.08MHz w/no notches
          mode = &quot;3&quot; 2.01Mhz to 7.54MHz w/HAM and Aero notches
          mode = &quot;4&quot; 2.01Mhz to 11.91Mhz w/no notches
          mode = &quot;5&quot; 2.01MHz to 11.91MHz w/ HAM and Aero notches
          mode = &quot;6a&quot; 2.0Mhz to 13.0Mhz w/HAM bands notched
          mode = &quot;6b&quot; 17.0Mhz to 28.0Mhz w/HAM bands notched
          mode = &quot;7a&quot; 2.0MHz to 10.1MHz w/HAM bands notched
          mode = &quot;7b&quot; 14.3MHz to 28.0MHz w/HAM bands notched
          mode = &quot;8a&quot; 2.0MHz to 16.0MHz w/HAM bands notched
          mode = &quot;8b&quot; 21.0MHz to 28.0MHz w/HAM bands notched
          mode = &quot;9a&quot; 2.0MHz to 9.0MHz w/HAM bands notched
          mode = &quot;9b&quot; 11.0MHz to 17.0MHz w/HAM bands notched
          mode = &quot;9c&quot; 22.0MHz to 28.0MHz w/HAM bands notched

       This  example  will notch a device from 2.0Mhz to 10.0Mhz because we specified mode as 6a.
       The affected device is determined by variable DEV. The assiciated prescaler file from  the
       folder defined by variable DIR will be used. A brief confirmation message will appear.

          # fdm.sh 6a

          Setting modem to 2.0Mhz to 13.0Mhz w/HAM bands notched
