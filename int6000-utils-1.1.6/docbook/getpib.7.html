getpib(7)                             Intellon Linux Toolkit                            getpib(7)

NAME
       getpib - Intellon PIB Data Extractor

SYNOPSIS
       getpib file offset format [length]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is a companion to program setpib and is designed to support shell scripts. It
       extracts PIB file parameters so that a scripting  language  can  evaluate,  manipulate  or
       store them with minimal effort. Good scripting skills and some imagination may be required
       to make effective use of this program.

       Users having a detailed knowledge of PIB content and structure can make  extremely  effec‐
       tive  use  of  this program; however, Intellon is under no obligation to provide customers
       with the offset, length or format of PIB file parameters.

       This program is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for  an  overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -q     Enable quiet mode which has no effect.

       -v     Print  a  dump  of  the  edited region. The extent of displayed data can be changed
              using option -w.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over  other
              options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print  program  version  information  on  stdout. This option takes precedence over
              other options on the command line. Usethis option  when  sending  screen  dumps  to
              Intellon  Technical  Support  so  that they know exactly which version of the Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The PIB filename. This argument is required and must appear first  on  the  command
              line.  No  assumptions  are  made based on filename and no filename conventions are
              enforced; however, an invalid PIB file will be rejected.

       offset The data offset in bytes expressed in hexadecimal. This argument  is  required  and
              must  follow  the filename. A leading &quot;0x&quot; prefix is optional. The data offset plus
              the data length cannot exceed the file extent.

       format The output format. This argument is required and must follow the offset. Some  for‐
              mats  imply  fixed  data  length.  Others formats are for variable length data. The
              fixed data formats are byte, word, long, hfid, mac and key. The variable data  for‐
              mats are data and text. The formats are described in the next section.

       length The  data  length in bytes expressed in decimal. This argument is only required for
              the the data formats data and text. The data offset plus  the  data  length  cannot
              exceed the file extent. The data length cannot exceed 1024.

FORMATS
       byte   Extract  1  byte  and  display it as an unsigned decimal integer string. The offset
              advances  byte before starting another extraction.

       word   Extract 2 consecutive bytes and display them as an unsigned decimal integer  string
              after  endian  conversion.   The  offset  advances   bytes  before starting another
              extraction.

       long   Extract 4 consecutive bytes and display them as an unsigned decimal integer  string
              after  endian  conversion.   The  offset  advances  4 bytes before starting another
              extraction.

       hfid   Extract 64 consecutive bytes and display them as an ASCII string that terminates at
              the  first  non-printable  character.  The offset advances 64 bytes before starting
              another extraction. This format is equivalent to &quot;text 64&quot;.

       mac    Extract 6 bytes and display them as a colon-separated hexadecimal string. The  off‐
              set advances  bytes before starting another extraction. This is similar to &quot;data 6&quot;
              but colons separate octets.

       key    Extract 16 bytes and display them as a colon-separated hexadecimal string. The off‐
              set  advances 16 bytes before starting another extraction. This is similar to &quot;data
              16&quot; but colons separate octets.

       data length
              Extract the specified number of bytes and display them as a hexadecimal string with
              no punctuation to separate octets. The offset advances length bytes before starting
              another extraction. The minimum length is 1. The maximum length is 1024.

       text length
              Extract the specified number of bytes and display them as an  ASCII  string  termi‐
              nated  at  first  non-printable  character. The offset advances length bytes before
              starting another extraction. The minimum length is 1. The maximum length is 1024.

       skip length
              Advance the specified number of  bytes  without  displaying  anything.  The  offset
              advances  by length bytes before starting another extraction. The minimum length is
              1. The maximum length is 1024.

EXAMPLES
       The following example extracts one byte from offset 01F7 of PIB file abc.pib and  displays
       it  as  an  unsigned decimal integer string. No length specification is needed because the
       byte format has an implied length of 1 byte. The displayed value is 232 because  the  byte
       format  is  decimal.  We could have specified &quot;data 1&quot; to display the byte in hexadecimal.
       The return prompt appears on the display line because option -n was omitted.

          # getpib abc.pib 01F7 byte
          232#

       The next example extracts two bytes at offset 01F7 and  displays  them  as  a  hexadecimal
       string.  A length of 2 is needed because the data format is variable length. We could have
       specified &quot;word&quot; to display these bytes as an unsigned decimal integer  string.  The  hex‐
       adecimal string consists two octets E8 and 8A. The first byte is the same one extracted in
       the last example. The return prompt appears on a new line because option -n was present.

          # getpib abc.pib 01F7 data 2 -n
          E88A
          #
