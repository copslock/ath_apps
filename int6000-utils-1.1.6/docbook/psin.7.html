psin(7)                               Intellon Linux Toolkit                              psin(7)

NAME
       psin - Import PIB Prescalers

SYNOPSIS
       psin [options] [&lt;stdin] file

SYNOPSIS
       Import  an  amplitude  map,  read  from  stdin,  and insert it into and existing PIB file,
       replacing previous amplitude map values. Intellon can provide standard amplitude maps  (or
       prescalers)  that  conform  to  most  national or international EMI regulations. Generally
       speaking, these maps should not be modified but there are execeptions. This  program  per‐
       mits  custom  amplitude  maps to be loaded into an PIB file. It can also be used to copy a
       map directly from one PIB file to another when used with program psout.

       This program is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for  an  overview
       and installation instructions.

CAVEATS
       The Intellon Windows Device Manager determines the type of prescalars stored in the PIB by
       inspecting the ToneMaskType code which is also stored in the PIB but is not  part  of  the
       prescalar set. If this program is used to store a new prescalar set in a PIB and the Tone‐
       MaskType code is not updated to reflect the change then the Windows  Device  Manager  will
       continue  to display the previous prescalar type. This will confuse Windows Device Manager
       users. Use program setpib to set the ToneMaskType code and program  pskey  to  verify  the
       true prescalar type.

       Tampering  with  prescalar  settings may violate national or international electo-magnetic
       emission standards and lead to fines or penalties. Intellon Corporation shall not be  held
       responsible for any consequences of modifications made to prescalar sets provided to their
       customers.

OPTIONS
       None.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The name of an Intellon  Parameter  Information  Block  (PIB)  file.  The  original
              prescalers  are  replaced and the checksum is re-computed. By convention, PIB files
              have a .pib extension but this program does not enforce that  convention  and  does
              not  make any assumption based on filename or extension but the program will reject
              invalid PIB files. Only one file may be specified on the command line.

FILES
       An amplitude map consists of 1155 frequency-amplitude pairs. Each pair consists of a deci‐
       mal  index  and  a  hexadecimal scaler value. The index represents a frequecy from 1.8 mhz
       through 30 mhz. The scaler represents the amplitude attenuation applied at that frequency.
       The frequency and attenuation are computed as follows.

          frequency = 40.96 * (index + 74)
          decibels = 20 * log10 (scaler / 256)

EXAMPLE
       The following example loads prescaler file abc.psc into PIB file abc.pib. The ToneMaskType
       code is not updated by this operation and should be updated separately to avoid  confusing
       Windows Device Manager users. Program setpib is one means of updating this code.

          # psin &lt; abc.psc abc.pib

DISCLAIMER
       PIB  file structure and content is proprietary to Intellon Corporation, Ocala FL USA. Con‐
       sequently, public information is not available. Intellon Corporation reserves the right to
       modify PIB file structure or content in future firmware releases without any obligation to
       notify or compensate users of this program.
