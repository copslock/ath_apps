NAME
       Intellon Linux Toolkit

SYNOPSIS
       Intellon Corporation, Ocala FL USA, provides this Intellon Linux Toolkit to customers free
       of charge. The toolkit contains C Language source code and GNU makefiles to  compile  sev‐
       eral  useful  programs. It also includes shell scripts that use these programs, in various
       ways, to interrogate, control and manage Intellon powerline devices.  These  programs  are
       intended  for  hardware engineers and embedded software developers, consequently, they are
       simple and compact by design. They are not intended for end users or computer novices.

INSTALLATION
       The Intellon Linux Toolkit is distributed as a tarball  named  int6000-utils-x.x.x.tar.gz.
       Unpack  the  tarball  and  change  to the directory that it creates. To compile the source
       code, type &quot;make&quot;. To install the programs, type &quot;make install&quot;.  To  install  man  pages,
       type  &quot;make  manuals&quot;. To uninstall programs and man pages, type &quot;make uninstall&quot;. To read
       about the Toolkit, browse file docbook/index.html. This  package  does  not  automatically
       install scripts or html pages and so you must copy them to preferred locations.

       We recommend that you login as root before installing this package; otherwise, you will be
       prompted for the root password as each component is installed. Programs are  installed  in
       /usr/local/bin.  Man  pages are installed in /usr/share/man/man[1-9]. If these folders are
       not correct for your system, or if you want to install in other folders, then edit  folder
       names  defined  in the Makefile in each package folder. The package has been compiled in a
       variety of Linux distributions, including redhat, debian, ubuntu  and  monta  vista.  They
       have  also  been  cross-compiled  for MIPS but Intellon does not provide support for cross
       compilation efforts.

       Although this package has been compiled on several platforms, there is no  guarantee  that
       it  will  compile  without  errors or warnings on non-GNU/Linux platforms. We continuously
       update the package but do not attempt  to  compile  or  test  it  on  systems  other  than
       GNU/Linux  and Microsoft VisualStudio .NET. Some programs have been excluded from the Win‐
       dows installation for technical reasons.

BACKGROUND
       HomePlug 1.0 and HomePlug AV are industry standard protocols for powerline communications.
       Intellon  manufactures a family of chipsets that conform to these standards and have vari‐
       ous USBm PCI, MII and Ethernet interfaces. The INT5100 and INT5200 are the cornerstones of
       the  Intellon  chipset  family. The INT6000, INT6300 and INT6400 chipsets are the flagship
       members of the Intellon chipset family.

       The HomePlug 1.0 protocol is based on IEEE-802.3, has ethertype 0x887B  and  uses  special
       message formats.

       The  HomePlug  AV  protocol  is based on IEEE-802.3, has ethertype 0x88E1 and uses special
       message formats. A subset of those message formats are unspecified so that chipset vendors
       can  define  message formats for their own products. Intellon uses this subset to communi‐
       cate between host processors and Intellon devices.  Intellon  vendor  specific  management
       message formats are described in the Intellon HomePlugAV Firmware Technical Reference Man‐
       ual. This toolkit uses Intellon vendor  specific  message  formats  to  communicates  with
       Intellon devices and reads or writes Intellon specific file formats.

       Each  program  in the toolkit deals with a narrow aspect of Intellon device management but
       any or all can be called from shell scripts to perform complex tasks. With them,  one  can
       identify  chipset  hardware  and  firmware version, reset devices, flash devices, identify
       other Intellon network devices, validate *.pib and *.nvm files, sniff HomePlug AV Ethernet
       frames, send generic Ethernet frames and so on.

       The source code is designed to demonstrate and educate and may be modified without obliga‐
       tion to Intellon. Intellon would appreciate feedback concerning changes that  improve  the
       useability,  reliability  or  efficiency. Keep in mind that these tools are intended to be
       small and simple.

TOOLS
       There are many independent programs in this package. Significant ones  are  listed  below.
       See html/overview.html for more information about the Intellon Linux Toolkit.

       chknvm A  command  line utility that validates NVM files based on internal header informa‐
              tion, filesize, checksums and other general characteristics. Optionally, it can  be
              used  to display all image headers within an NVM file or the firmware revision con‐
              tained in the file.

       chkpib A command line utility that validates PIB files based on internal  header  informa‐
              tion, filesize, checksum, and other general characteristics. It can also be used to
              produce a text catalog of PIB files contained in a directory.

       coqos_add
              CoQoS stream utility. No description.

       coqos_info
              CoQoS stream utility. No description.

              CoQoS stream utility. No description.

       coqos_rel
              CoQoS stream utility. No description.

       efsu   A utility to send freeform Ethernet frames. Frames are defined as text  files  con‐
              taining  hexadecimal  byte  codes having optional comments and whitespace. Comments
              and white space are stripped from the input file and the hexadecimal byte codes are
              transmitted as Ethernet frames.

       fp     A command line utility that prints the SHA256 digest for one or more files based on
              their content. Output can be used to compare files or identify files based soley on
              their content despite any filename changes.

       getpib A command line utility for extracting data from a valid PIB file based on data off‐
              set, length and format. It is a companion to  program  setpib.  Both  programs  are
              intended  for  use  in shell scripts. Users must have some knowledge about the data
              they are extracting.

       hpav   An basic  packet  sniffer  that  displays  incoming  HomePlug  AV  protocol  frames
              addressed to the host as they arrive. The program may be run in the background as a
              daemon.

       hpavkey
              A HomePlug AV key generator. HomePlug AV devices use has keys for various purposes.
              This  program  converts  one  or more pass phrases, entered on the command line, to
              either DAKs, NMKs or NIDs. It is similar to hpavkeys  but converts a limited number
              of pass phrases at one time.

       hpavkeys
              A  HomePlug AV key generator. This program is similar to hpavkey but converts large
              number of pass phrases, read from stdin, and converts them to either DAKs, NMKs  or
              NIDs.

       int6k  A  basic  device  manager used to inspect and control Intellon INT6x00 devices con‐
              nected to the local host. It is similar to int6k2 but is more modular in  construc‐
              tion.

       int6k2 A  basic  device  manager used to inspect and control Intellon INT6x00 devices con‐
              nected to the local host. It is similar to  int6k  but  is  implemented  using  the
              Intellon Embedded API.

       int6keth
              A command line utility to read and write device Ethernet PHY settings.

       int6kf A  basic  flash  utility used to initialize INT6300 devices having no flash memory,
              blank flash memory or corrupted memory. It interacts with the Intellon Boot  Loader
              to  download  SDRAM configuration, runtime firmware and PIB. It can also be used to
              force flash blank or corrupted flash memory.

       int6khost
              A example embedded host emulator that responds to VS_HST_ACTION messages sent  from
              a  flash-less  device  to a local host processor. It can be used to investigate and
              verify device-to-host interaction. The Intellon embedded API  can  perform  similar
              functionality in a production environment.

       int6khost64
              An updated version of int6khost that omits the needed for an external SDRAM config‐
              uration file. It takes advantage of the memctl applet included in the  newer  *.nvm
              files.

       int6kid
              A  command  line  utility to print the DAK or NMK read from one or more devices. It
              can be used in shell scripts to dynamically obtain device  key  values  and  insert
              them on the command line of other programs.

       int6km A  basic memory read utility used to inspect INT6x000 accessible SDRAM memory loca‐
              tions and mapped registers. Not all locations or registers are accessible.

       int6kmod
              A command line utility that downloads raw modules  using   a  sequence  of  VS_MOD‐
              ULE_OPERATION messages.

       int6kprobe
              A  command  line  utility  that  detects  and  reports  neighbor networks using the
              VS_DIAG_PROBE message.

       int6krate
              A command line utility that reports computed PHY rates for a single device  or  all
              devices on a logical network. Ouput is designed for import into a spread sheet.

       int6krule
              A  command  line  utility used to format and send classification rules to a device.
              Classification rules are specified using symbolic names for actions, options,  con‐
              ditons and frame fields.

       int6kstat
              A command line utility that prints device link statistics on stdout in a relatively
              undecorated format. Output is designed for easy interpretation by other programs.

       int6ktest
              A command line utility to download and execute a series  of  test  applets  to  the
              local  powerline  device. It is not for general use because there are no interlocks
              to prevent loading images designed for other platforms or loading images in illogi‐
              cal order.

       int6kwait
              A  command  line  utility  used  to  pause shell scripts at critical points where a
              device must be in a known state before proceeding. Typical  cases  involve  waiting
              for  device power off or reset, power on or restart and network device association.

       mac2pw A device password generator that prints a range of MAC addresses and user passwords
              on  stdout.  It  is  an  alternative  to  the Intellon Production Test System (PTS)
              DBBuilder Utility.

       mac2pwd
              A device password generator that reads MAC addresses from one or more  input  files
              and  prints addresses and passwords on stdout. It is an alternative to the Intellon
              Production Test System (PTS) DBBuilder utility.

       modpib A basic command line PIB editor used to change the MAC, DAK and/or NMK of an exist‐
              ing  PIB  file. It can also be used to change the manufacturer string, network name
              and username strings.

       mrgpib A command line utility to copy PIB settings from one PIB file to another where  the
              PIB files have different PIB versions.

       nvmmerge
              A  command  line  utility  to merge multiple applets or NVM files into a single NVM
              file.

       nvmsplit
              A command line utility to split an NVM file into multiple NVM files each containing
              one image. The original NVM file is preserved.

       odc    An offset-driven hex compare utility for analysing the difference between two files
              having a fixed structure. An offset definition file is required for proper use.

       odd    An offset-driven hex dump utility for analyzing any binary file that  has  a  fixed
              structured,  such  as an INT6000 PIB file or an INT5500 CFG file. An offset defini‐
              tion file is required for proper use.

       odx    An offset-driven XML generator used to convert an offset definition file,  used  by
              programs odc and odd, to an XML edit definition file used by program pxe.

       pibruin
              A classifier rule input utility used to insert multiple classifier rules into a pib
              file. Use program pibrump to read rules from another PIB file or create a rule file
              manually with any text editor. This program is an alternative to program int6krule.

       pibrump
              A classifier rule sump utility used to read rules from a PIB file and print them in
              a  format  similar  to  the  input  for  program  int6krule. The output can be read
              directly by program pibruin.

       pskey  Print the SHA256 digest for the amplitude make stored in a PIB file. The digest can
              be used as a fingerprint or signature for the prescaler set.

       psin   Read  a  prescaler  file  from  stdin and replace the amplitude map stored in a PIB
              file.

       psout  Read a PIB file and print a prescaler file suitable for input  using  psin  or  the
              WIndows Device Manager.

       rkey   A  command line utility to generate distinct HomePlug AV compliant keys from a user
              defined keyfile that seeds the hash algorithm. It can be used to dynamically gener‐
              ate  distinct keys inside shell scripts or create long lists of unique keys for use
              by other programs.

       setnvm A command line utility to modify slected header parameters for all image  within  a
              given NVM file. This program can be used to translate legacy NVM files to contempo‐
              rary NVM file and vice verse.

       setpib A command line utility to insert arbitrary values into a PIB  file  based  on  data
              offset,  length  and format then compute a new PIB checksum. This program is a gen‐
              eral purpose program intended for use in shell scripts  but  it  requires  detailed
              knowledge of PIB structure.

       weeder A  command line utility to set the programmable attenuators build into the Intellon
              Production Test System (PTS).

       There may be other programs added, from time to time, that are not listed here.
