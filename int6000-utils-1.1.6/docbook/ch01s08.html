			Toolkit Programs 
			</h2></div></div></div><p>
			The Intellon <span class="application">Linux Toolkit</span> is a collection of over 50 small programs. Each program deals with some aspect of Intellon device management but programs can be combined in various ways, using shell scripts, to perform sophisticated and complex tasks. With these program, one can identify chipset hardware and firmware version, reset devices, flash devices, identify other  Intellon  network devices, validate <code class="filename">*.pib</code> and <code class="filename">*.nvm</code> files, sniff <span class="trademark">HomePlug</span>® AV Ethernet frames, send generic Ethernet frames and so on. 
			</p><p>
			Program source code is designed to illustrate, demonstrate and educate software developers and hardware engineers. It may be modified without obligation to Intellon  Corporation. Intellon would appreciate feedback concerning changes that might improve the useability, reliability or efficiency. Keep in mind that these tools are intended to be simple and compact.

					A generic 'Remote PIB Management' tool. One or more XML files define decimal, hexadecimal and string edits to be applied to a PIB file. The PIB is read, edits are applied, a new checksum is computed and the PIB is saved. This program is installed in folder <code class="filename">/usr/local/bin</code> with 0555 file permissions. The main source code is located in folder <code class="filename">./pib</code>. See the <a class="ulink" href="pxe.7.html" target="_top">pxe</a> man page for more information.

					A command line utility to dynamically generate distinct HomePlug AV compliant keys from a user created keyfile. It can be used in shell scripts to dynamically insert random and distinct keys on program command lines as arguments. For example, a Linux bash script can reference "$(rkey -i eth0 -D secret.key)" inline. This program is installed in folder <code class="filename">/usr/local/bin</code> with 4555 file permissions. See the discussion on security for more information about file permissions. The main source code is located in folder <code class="filename">./crypt</code>. See the <a class="ulink" href="rkey.7.html" target="_top">rkey</a> man page for more information.

					A simple means of setting PIB parameters when the parameter offset, length and format are known. It is an alternative to program <a class="link" href="ch01s08.html#program-pxe">pxe</a> and a companion to program <a class="link" href="ch01s08.html#program-getpib">getpib</a>. The user specifies the filename, a starting offset and a sequence of type/data pairs. Edits are applied in order and a new checksum is computed. A full or partial dump of the PIB displays the result. This program is installed in folder <code class="filename">/usr/local/bin</code> with 0555 file permissions. The main source code is located in folder <code class="filename">./pib</code>. See the <a class="ulink" href="setpib.7.html" target="_top">setpib</a> man page for more information.
