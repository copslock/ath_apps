int6kf(7)                             Intellon Linux Toolkit                            int6kf(7)

NAME
       int6kf - INT6300 Flash Utility for Linux

SYNOPSIS
       int6kf [options] -C file -N file -P file

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  is  deprecated.  Use  int6kboot when downloading firmware 3.3.4 or later on
       INT6300 devices or later.

       Download and start runtime firmware on a local Intellon powerline device that is in  boot‐
       loader  mode.  A  device stays in bootloader mode when it cannot load firmware from NVRAM.
       That can happen because there is no NVRAM or because the NVRAM is blank or corrupted.  The
       bootloader  only  understands  a  subset of Intellon message types and cannot flash NVRAM.
       This program uses that subset to download runtime firmware and  start  execution.  Option‐
       ally, it will proceed to flash NVRAM after the firmware has started.

       Booting  a  device  is  a two part operation. The first part downloads SDRAM configuration
       parameters then download runtime  firmware  and  parameters  into  SDRAM  and  starts  the
       firmware.  The  second  part downloads runtime firmare and parameters (again) into scratch
       buffers and instructs the firmware to write them into to NVRAM. This program  can  perform
       the  first part alone or the first then the second part but not the second part alone. The
       second part can be performed alone using program int6k.

       This program is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page  for  compilation
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -a     Wait  until  device  sends a VS_HOST_ACTION.IND before downloading SDRAM configura‐
              tion, firmware and PIB.

       -C filename
              Read the named SDRAM configuration file and write it to the device. This option and
              argument  are  required. Any file having an invalid SDRAM configuration file format
              will be rejected. No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conven‐
              tions are enforced.

       -e     Redirects  stderr  messages  to stdout. By convention status and error messages are
              printed on stderr while primary program output is printed on  stdout.  This  option
              prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -F[F]  Write  previously downloaded MAC and PIB to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM. Adding a second
              F here or another -F anywhere on the command line will force-flash a blank or  cor‐
              rupted  NVRAM.  Firmware loaded from NVRAM will treat force-flash as an error. This
              option can be used to create factory settings but cannot be  used  to  change  them
              once  created.  Subsequent use creates and updates operational settings that can be
              erased using a factory reset. This option is executed after all others on the  com‐
              mand line, except for the -R option.

       -i interface
              Select  the  host  Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this interface and
              only reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface  is
              eth1  because  most people use eth0 as their principle network connection; however,
              if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence  over  the  default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -N filename
              Read  the  named  NVM file and write it to the device. This option and argument are
              required. Any file having an invalid NVM file format will be rejected.  No  assump‐
              tions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced.

       -P filename
              Read  the  named  PIB file and write it to the device. This option and argument are
              required. Any file  having  an  invalid  PIB  file  format  will  be  rejected.  No
              assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -v     Prints  additional information on stdout. In particular, this option dumps outgoing
              Ethernet packets on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over  other
              options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print  program  version  information  on  stdout. This option takes precedence over
              other options on the command line. Use this option when  sending  screen  dumps  to
              Intellon  Technical  Support  so  that they know exactly which version of the Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       None.

EXAMPLES
       The -C, -N and -P options are always required. Their order is not important.  Notice  that
       no  MAC  address  is  needed  because  devices  use address 00:B0:52:00:00:01, the program
       default address, when in bootloader mode.

          int6kf -C test.cfg -N test.nvm -P test.pib
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write SDRAM Configuration
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Start Firmware
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Started.

       Downloads SDRAM configuration file test.cfg with  VS_SET_SDRAM  then  firmware  from  file
       test.nvm  with  VS_WR_MEM  then PIB from file test.pib then starts firmware execution with
       VS_ST_MAC. This operation is common on flash-less systems.

          int6kf -C test.cfg -N test.nvm -P test.pib -F
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write SDRAM Configuration
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Start Firmware
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Started.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write MAC as module
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write PIB as module
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Flash Device
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Flashed.

       Perform the same actions as before with some extra steps. After starting  firmware  execu‐
       tion,  the  same  firmware  and  PIB  are  downloaded  again,  using  VS_WR_MOD instead of
       VS_WR_MEM, and written to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM with force. The force option is only rec‐
       ognized  by  firmware  that has been started by the bootloader and will fail when no flash
       memory is present.
