int6klog(7)                           Intellon Linux Toolkit                          int6klog(7)

NAME
       int6klog - Intellon Log File Manager

SYNOPSIS
       int6klog [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Read and print various device logs to file for analysis by Intellon Technical Support.

       This  program  is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for an overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout. By convention status and  error  messages  are
              printed  on  stderr  while primary program output is printed on stdout. This option
              prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i interface
              Select the host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via  this  interface  and
              only  reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface is
              eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle network  connection;  however,
              if  environment  string  &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout. In particular, this option  dumps  incoming
              and outgoing packets which can be saved as text files for reference.

       -w filename
              Read  Watchdog  Report  from  the  device  and  write  it  to  the named file using
              VS_WD_RPT. The report is dumped in binary format by default but is  dumped  in  XML
              format  when option -x is present. The report file can be sent to Intellon Corpora‐
              tion for technical analysis. No assumptions are made based on filename and no file‐
              name  convetions  are  enforced;  however,  you should use a .log file extension to
              indicate binary format.

       -W filename
              Same as option -w but clears the Watchdog Report after reading it.

       -x     Formats the Watchdog Report file in XML format when used with options -w or -W.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over  other
              options on the command line.

       -?,--version
              Print  program  version  information  on  stdout. This option takes precedence over
              other options on the command line. Use this option when  sending  screen  dumps  to
              Intellon  Technical  Support  so  that they know exactly which version of the Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The MAC address of some powerline device. More than one address may  be  specified.
              If  more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device
              in turn. The default address is local. See DEVICES for information  about  symbolic
              device addresses.

LOGFILES
       Log files are save in binary format by default but they can also be saved in XML format by
       adding option -x to the command line. By convention, binary log files have a  .log  exten‐
       sion  and XML log files have a .xlog extension. The extension is not critical but it helps
       us determine the format before we open the file.

DEVICES
       Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. MAC addresses are  12
       hexadecimal  digits  (0123456789ABCDEFabcdef)  in  upper,  lower or mixed case. Individual
       octets may be separated by colons, for clarity, but not all octets need to  be  seperated.
       For example, &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equiva‐
       lent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be expressed by name instead of number.

       all    Equivalent to &quot;broadcast&quot;, described next.

       broadcast
              A synonym for the  standard  Ethernet  broadcast  address,  FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All
              devices, whether local, remote or foreign will respond to this address.

       local  A  synonym  for  the  Intellon  vendor  specific  Local  Management  Address (LMA),
              00:B0:52:00:00:01. All local Intellon  devices  will  recognize  this  address  but
              remote  and  foreign devices will not. A remote device is any device at the far end
              of a powerline connection. A foreign device  is  any  device  not  manufactured  by
              Intellon.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example  reads the Watchdog Report and writes it to file abc.log in binary
       format. Information will continue to accumulate on the device because option -w  does  not
       clear the report. We must explicitly name a device on the command when creating files.

          # int6klog -w abc.log 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Read Watchdog Report
          eth1 00:B0:52:BE:EF:03 Read abc.log

       The next example does the same thing as the last example but clears the report after read‐
       ing. We forgot the MAC address of the local device and so  we  used  the  symbolic  device
       address  local.  Notice  that  option -W is the upper case version of option -w because it
       affects device behavior. There is no indication that the report has cleared but trust  us.
       It cleared.

          # int6klog -W abc.log local
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Read Watchdog Report
          eth1 00:B0:52:BE:EF:03 Read abc.log

       The next example does the same as the first example but saves the report in XML format. We
       used file extension .xlog to distinguish XML from binary format.

          # int6klog -W abc.xlog local
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Read Watchdog Report
          eth1 00:B0:52:BE:EF:03 Read abc.log
