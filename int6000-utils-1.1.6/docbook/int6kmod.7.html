int6kmod(7)                           Intellon Linux Toolkit                          int6kmod(7)

NAME
       int6kmod - Intellon Module Management Utility

SYNOPSIS
       int6kmod [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Read  or  write an Intellon module file to or from a device using VS_MODULE_OPERATION mes‐
       sages.

       This program is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for  an  overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -e     Redirects  stderr  messages  to stdout. By convention status and error messages are
              printed on stderr while primary program output is printed on  stdout.  This  option
              prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i interface
              Select  the  host  Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this interface and
              only reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface  is
              eth1  because  most people use eth0 as their principle network connection; however,
              if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence  over  the  default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -m filename
              Read  the specified module from NVRAM and write it to a file. The module is identi‐
              fied by module and sub-module using options -t and -s. Runtime firmware will report
              an error if the module is not available.

       -M filename
              Read  the  named  module  file  and  download it to the device NVRAM. The module is
              assigned to a module and sub-module identifier using options  -t  and  -s.  Runtime
              firmware  will  reject modules having invalid module and sub-mocule idetnifiers. As
              implemented, int6kmod will reject files exceeding 1400 bytes but  this  restriction
              will be removed in later versions.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -s sub-module-id
              The  sub-module  identifier  expressed  as  a 16-bit deciaml, hexadecimal or binary
              value. This identifier indicates a specific module with the module class  specified
              using  option  -t.  Any  16-bit  value is permitted but only certain values will be
              accepted by device firmware. The default value is 0x0000.

       -S session-id
              The session identifier expressed as a 32-bit hexadecimal value. Any 32-bit value is
              permitted  except  for  0x00000000  and  0xFFFFFFFF. The program will use a default
              value when this option is omitted.

       -t module-id
              The module identifier expressed as a 16-bit decimal, hexadecimal or  binary  value.
              This  identifier  indicates  the module type or class. Option -s indicates the spe‐
              cific member of a module class. Any 16-bit value is permitted but only certain val‐
              ues will be accepted by device firmware. The default value is 0x0000.

       -v     Print  additional  information on stdout. In particular, this option dumps incoming
              and outgoing packets which can be saved as text files for reference.

       -w     Write settings to the device instead of reading settings from the device. If  omit‐
              ted  then  settings  are  read  from the device and displayed. If present, the user
              should specify all settings to avoid writing default values to the device.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over  other
              options on the command line.

       -?,--version
              Print  program  version  information  on  stdout. This option takes precedence over
              other options on the command line. Use this option when  sending  screen  dumps  to
              Intellon  Technical  Support  so  that they know exactly which version of the Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The MAC address of some powerline device. More than one address may be specified on
              the  command  line.  If more than one address is specified then operations are per‐
              formed on each device in turn. The default address is local. See DEVICES for infor‐
              mation.

DEVICES
       Powerline  devices  use  Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. A MAC address is a
       48-bit value entered as 12 hexadecimal digits in upper, lower  or  mixed  character  case.
       Octets   may   be   separated  with  colons  for  clarity.  For  example,  &quot;00b052000001&quot;,
       &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A synonym for the  Ethernet  broadcast  address,  FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All  devices,
              whether local, remote or foreign recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote
              device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device  is
              any device not manufactured by Intellon.

       local  A  synonym  for  the  Intellon  vendor  specific  Local  Management  Address (LMA),
              00:B0:52:00:00:01. All local Intellon devices recognize this address but remote and
              foreign devices do not. A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline
              connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Intellon.

EXAMPLES
       The following command reads module file abc.bin and writes it to  the  local  device.  The
       module  identifier 0x1000 to indicate that it is an MDIO Init module. The sub-module iden‐
       tifer will default to 0x0000. The session identifier will default  to  some  static  value
       determined  by  the  program.  The operation takes place in three steps. The last step may
       take 2 or 3 seconds to complete.

          # int6kmod -M abc.bin -t 0x1000
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Request Session
          eth1 00:B0:52:BE:EF:03 Granted
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write abc.bin
          eth1 00:B0:52:BE:EF:03 Written
          eth1 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Commit Modules
          eth1 00:B0:52:BE:EF:03 Committed None.
