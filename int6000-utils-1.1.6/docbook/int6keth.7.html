int6keth(7)                           Intellon Linux Toolkit                          int6keth(7)

NAME
       int6keth - Intellon Ethernet PHY Settings

SYNOPSIS
       int6keth [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Read or write INT6x00 Ethernet PHY Settings using VS_ENET_SETTINGS.

       This  program  is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for an overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -a mode
              Advertise auto-negotiate capabilities. This option takes affect when option  -w  is
              present.  It  is  ignored  when  option  -r is present. Valid values are &quot;100Full&quot;,
              &quot;100Half&quot;, &quot;10Full&quot; and &quot;10Half&quot;. The default value is no advertisement of capabil‐
              ities.

       -d mode
              Device  duplex  transmission  mode.  This  option  takes  affect  when option -w is
              present. It is ignored when option -r is  present.  Valid  values  are  &quot;Half&quot;  and
              &quot;Full&quot;. The default value is &quot;Half&quot;.

       -e     Redirects  stderr  messages  to stdout. By convention status and error messages are
              printed on stderr while primary program output is printed on  stdout.  This  option
              prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -f control
              Flow  control  enable.  This  option  takes affect when option -w is present. It is
              ignored when option -r is present. Valid values are &quot;On&quot;, &quot;Off&quot;, &quot;Tx&quot; and &quot;Rx&quot;. The
              default value is &quot;Off&quot;.

       -n mode
              Auto-negotiate  mode.  This  option  takes  affect when option -w is present. It is
              ignored when option -r is present. Valid values are &quot;On&quot;  and  &quot;Off&quot;.  The  default
              value is &quot;On&quot;.

       -s speed
              Network  transmission  speed  in  mbps.  This option takes affect when option -w is
              present. It is ignored when option -r is present. Valid values are &quot;10&quot;, &quot;100&quot;  and
              &quot;1000&quot;. The default value is &quot;10&quot;.

       -i interface
              Select  the  host  Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this interface and
              only reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface  is
              eth1  because  most people use eth0 as their principle network connection; however,
              if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence  over  the  default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -r     Read  settings  from  the  device  instead  of writing settings to the device. This
              option is the default and may be omitted. If omitted or present,  options  -a,  -d,
              -f, -n and -s have no effect.

       -v     Print  additional  information on stdout. In particular, this option dumps incoming
              and outgoing packets which can be saved as text files for reference.

       -w     Write settings to the device instead of reading settings from the device. If  omit‐
              ted  then  settings  are  read  from the device and displayed. If present, the user
              should specify all settings to avoid writing default values to the device.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over  other
              options on the command line.

       -?,--version
              Print  program  version  information  on  stdout. This option takes precedence over
              other options on the command line. Use this option when  sending  screen  dumps  to
              Intellon  Technical  Support  so  that they know exactly which version of the Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The MAC address of some powerline device. More than one address may be specified on
              the  command  line.  If more than one address is specified then operations are per‐
              formed on each device in turn. The default address is local. See DEVICES for infor‐
              mation.

DEVICES
       Powerline  devices  use  Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. A MAC address is a
       48-bit value entered as 12 hexadecimal digits in upper, lower  or  mixed  character  case.
       Octets   may   be   separated  with  colons  for  clarity.  For  example,  &quot;00b052000001&quot;,
       &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A synonym for the  Ethernet  broadcast  address,  FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All  devices,
              whether local, remote or foreign recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote
              device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device  is
              any device not manufactured by Intellon.

       local  A  synonym  for  the  Intellon  vendor  specific  Local  Management  Address (LMA),
              00:B0:52:00:00:01. All local Intellon devices recognize this address but remote and
              foreign devices do not. A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline
              connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Intellon.
