CMEncrypt(7)                          Intellon Linux Toolkit                         CMEncrypt(7)

NAME
       CMEncrypt - Send Encrypted Payload

SYNOPSIS
       CMEncrypt [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Transmit a file over powerline using CM_ENCRYPTED_PAYLOAD messages. This program tests and
       demonstrates proper (or improper) message routing but does not support encrypted transmis‐
       sion. All payloads are sent unencrypted at this time.

OPTIONS
       -A status
              The  AVLN Status. This indicates the current association status and capabilities of
              the sending station. Permitted values are 0 through 8. The default is 0.

       -f file
              The name of the payload file. File content may be text or binary and forms the pay‐
              load  of  one  or more messages. Payloads are transmitted unencrypted when PID is 4
              and PEKS is 15 which is default.

       -K PEKS
              The Payload Encryption Key Select. This value indicates the key used to encrypt the
              payload.  Permitted values are 0 through 15. The default is 15 for &quot;No Encryption&quot;.

       -P PID The Protocol Identifier. This value detemines how the  payload  is  interpreted  by
              powerline devices. Permitted values are 0 through 4. The default is 4 for &quot;HLE Pro‐
              tocol&quot;.

       -v     Print incoming and outgoing Ethernet frames in hex dump format on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over  other
              options on the command line.

       -?,--version
              Print  program  version  information  on  stdout. This option takes precedence over
              other options on the command line. Use this option when  sending  screen  dumps  to
              Intellon  Technical  Support  so  that they know exactly which version of the Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The Media Access Control (MAC) address of a remote host, not  a  powerline  device.
              Addresses  are 6 hexadecimal octets optionally separated by colon. For example, the
              addresses &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are all valid and
              equivalent.   For   convenience,   the   symbolic   address   &quot;local&quot;  resolves  to
              &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and the symbolic addresses &quot;all&quot; and &quot;broadcast&quot;  both  resolve
              to &quot;ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff&quot;.

INTERNALS
       This  program  lets  the user specify some CM_ENCRYPTED_PAYLOAD fields but not others. The
       following are fields that the user cannot  specify.  The  program  automatically  computes
       these values.

       PRN    The  Protocol  Run Number. This is a random number used to distinguish between runs
              having the same protocol. This program uses the system time variable.

       UUID   The Universally Unique Identifier. This program uses the left-most 16 bytes of  the
              SHA256 digest for the payload.

REFERENCES
       Consult  the HomePlug AV Specification or Intellon Firmware Technical Reference Manual for
       more information.

EXAMPLES
       The following example transmits file myfile.txt to host  00:85:73:00:94:01  in  unecrypted
       format  because  that is the program default. The remote address is required and refers to
       the ultimate recipient, not the local device.

          # CMEncrypt -f myfile.txt 00:85:73:00:94:01 The next example does the same  but  speci‐
       fies  the  program  defaults. Observe that operands can be expressed in decimal, binary or
       hexadecimal format.

          # CMEncrypt -f myfile.txt -A 0 -P 0b0100 -K 0x0F 00:85:73:00:94:01
