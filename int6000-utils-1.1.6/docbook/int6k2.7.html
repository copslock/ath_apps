NAME
       int6k2 - Intellon Device Manager for Linux

SYNOPSIS
       int6k2 [options] device [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       This version of the Intellon Device Manager for Linux performs the basic device operations
       described in the Intellon HomePlug AV API Users Guide using Intellon HomePlug AV API soft‐
       ware. THe program can be used to initialize devices, interrogate them and control them. It
       can also upgrade them when on-board NVRAM is present.  It  supports  INT6000  devices  and
       INT6300 devices with or without on-board NVRAM. See int6k for an alternative that uses raw
       Ethernet packets to perform similar operations.

       This program is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for  an  overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       device The  Media Access Control (MAC) address of some device. Addresses are 6 hexadecimal
              octets optionally separated by colon. For example,  the  addresses  &quot;00b052000001&quot;,
              &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot;  and  &quot;00b052:000001&quot;  are all valid and equivalent. For conve‐
              nience, the symbolic address &quot;local&quot; resolves to &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and  the  sym‐
              bolic addresses &quot;all&quot; and &quot;broadcast&quot; both resolve to &quot;ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff&quot;.

       -D xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
              Define  the  16 octet Device Access Key (DAK) in hex format. The DAK is used by the
              -J option. The symbolic names, &quot;key1&quot; and &quot;key2&quot; are recognized as described in the
              KEYS section.

       -F option
              Intialize  the  device using ihpapi_InitializeDevice. option must be &quot;INT6K_FLASH&quot;,
              &quot;INT6K_NOFLASH&quot; or &quot;INT6K_FW_FLASH&quot; as defined in  the  Intellon  Homeplug  AV  API
              Users Guide.

       -h     Wait  indefinitely  for  VS_HST_ACTION messages from devices and service them. This
              effectively behaves like an embedded host processor for upgrade and  bootload  pur‐
              poses.

       -i interface
              Select  the  host  Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this interface and
              only reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface  is
              eth1  because  most people use eth0 as their principle network connection; however,
              if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence  over  the  default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -I     Read  the  device  parameter block using ihpapi_UpdateDevice and print the firmware
              major revision number, PIB minor revision number, Device Access Key (DAK),  Network
              Membership Key (NMK), MAC address and other information on stdout.

       -J     Set  the  Network Membership Key (NMK) on a remote device using iphapi_SetKey. This
              is similar to option -K but requires the remote device DAK in addition to  NMK  and
              MAC  address.  The  NMK value is defined using option -K unless you want to use the
              default value. The remote Device Access Key (DAK) is defined using option -D unless
              you  want  to use the default value. Programming remote device keys is complicated.
              It is often easier to connect the device directly to the host and  use  option  -K.
              The  default value for both the DAK and NMK key is &quot;key1&quot; which as described in the
              KEYS section below.

       -K xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
              Define the Network Membership Key (NMK) used by options -M or -J. It  may  also  be
              set to &quot;key1&quot; or &quot;key2&quot;, in which case they will be replaced with the keys shown in
              the KEYS section below.

       -m     Read network topology information using ihpapi_GetNetworkInfo.

       -M     Sets the Network Membership Key (NMK) on the local device using ihpapi_SetKey.  The
              NMK value is defined using option -K unless you want to use the default value.

       -l count
              Repeat command line operations count times for each device. This is most often used
              for one device.

       -n filename
              Read firmware  from  the  device  and  write  it  to  the  named  .nvm  file  using
              ihpapi_UpdateDevice. No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename con‐
              ventions are enforced. This option is performed before -N when both are  specified.

       -N filename
              Read  the named .nvm file and write it to the device using ihpapi_InitializeDevice.
              No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced;
              however,  files having invalid.nvm format will be rejected. This option is executed
              after -n when both are specified.

       -p filename
              Read the device parameter  block  and  write  it  to  the  named  .pib  file  using
              ihpapi_UpdateDevice. No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename con‐
              vetions are enforced. This option is executed before BP when both are specified.

       -P filename
              Read the named .pib and write it to the device  using  ihpapi_InitializeDevice.  No
              assumptions  are  made  based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced;
              however, files having invalid.pib format will be rejected. This option is  executed
              after -p when both are specified.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stdout.

       -r     Read  device  firmware  and  hardware revision using ihpapi_GetVersionInfo. Example
              output     might     look      lik      &quot;eth0      00:B0:52:00:00:01      INT6300A0
              INT6000-MAC-2-0-2000-1018-20070611-SP1-B NOT-UPGRADEABLE&quot;.

       -R     Reset the device using ihpapi_ResetDevice. This option is executed after all others
              specified on the same command line.

       -s     Read the device manufacturer string using ihpapi_GetManufacturerInfo.

       -S filename
              Read the named .config file and write it to the device using ihpapi_SetSDRAMConfig.
              No assumptions are make based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced.
              Do not confuse.config with.cfg files. See chkcfg and config2cfg for  more  informa‐
              tion on SDRAM configuration file formats.

       -T     Reset device to factory defaults using ihapi_ResetFactoryDefaults.

       -v     Prints  additional information on stdout. In particular, this option dumps incoming
              and outgoing packets on stdout.

       -w seconds
              Define the number of seconds to wait before repeating command  line  options.  This
              value only has effect when option -l is specified with a non-zero value.

       -x     Cause the program to exit immediately on the first error instead of continuing with
              remaining iterations, operations or devices. Normally, the program  reports  errors
              and  moves  on  to the next operation, iteration or device depending on the command
              line.

       -?, --help
              Displays program help information on stdout. This option takes precedence over  all
              other options on the command line except -! and --version.

       -!, --version
              Displays  program  version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over
              all other options on the command line except -? or --help.  Use  this  option  when
              sending screen dumps to Intellon technical staff.

KEYS
       Encryption  keys  are  long, tedious to type and prone to error. The symbolic names &quot;key1&quot;
       and &quot;key2&quot; may be used when specifying key values for options -D  and  -K.  Symbol  &quot;key1&quot;
       translates  to  the  HomePlug  AV  compliant hash for password &quot;HomePlugAV&quot;. Symbol &quot;key2&quot;
       translates to the HomePlug AV compliant hash for  password  &quot;HomePlugAV0123&quot;.  The  hashed
       value  for  a given pass phrase is different for DAK and NMK. These symbols are for conve‐
       nience only.

EXAMPLES
       The following set of  examples  illustrate  a  typical  flash-less  device  initialization
       sequence.  It  assumes that the reader is familiar with difference between boot-from-flash
       and boot-from-host operations..PP The following command  requests  hardware  and  firmware
       revision  information  from  the local device. Since no hardware address is specified, the
       default address, 00:B0:52:00:00:01, is used. The is  sent  over  Ethernet  interface  eth1
       because  that  is  the  default Ethernet interface unless the environment variable PLC has
       been defined.

       # int6k2 -r

       Since the following steps are only recognized by the bootloader program, verify  that  the
       previous  command indicates that the Intellon bootloader is running..PP The following com‐
       mand downloads SDRAM Configuration file, 16MB_SDRAM.config, to the bootloader so that  the
       bootloader  knows can determine to store information that will be downloaded in successive
       steps. Normally, the bootloader would automatically read this information from  NVRAM  but
       there is no NVRAM in this example.

       # int6k2 -S 16MB_SDRAM.config local

       Unlike  programs  int6k  and  int6kf, the SDRAM configuration configuration file used here
       specifies parameters as a 64 character ASCII hexadecimal character string  instead  of  32
       binary bytes. This format is the same one used by the Intellon Windows Device Manager.

       The  following command downloads PIB file, WA-NA.pib, and NVM file, vs-B-LA.nvm, one after
       the other under control of the bootloader and starts firmware execution when the  download
       completes. This operation is multi-stage.

       # int6k2 -P WA-NA.pib -N v3-B-LA.nvm local

       The  following command, as above, requests hardware and firmware revision information from
       the local device. It convirms that the download was successful.

       # int6k2 -r
