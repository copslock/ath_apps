int6k(7)                              Intellon Linux Toolkit                             int6k(7)

NAME
       int6k - Device Manager for Linux

SYNOPSIS
       int6k [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       This  version of the Intellon Device Manager for Linux performs basic operations on Intel‐
       lon INT6x00 devices using the raw Ethernet protocol described in the Intellon HomePlug  AV
       Firmware  Technical Reference Manual. It can be used to interrogate and control devices or
       upgrade firmware if on-board NVRAM is present. See int6k2 for an alternative utility  that
       uses the Intellon Embedded API to perform similar operations.

       This  program  is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the ilt man page for an overview
       and installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       -a     Read device attributes using VS_OP_ATTRIBUTES. Attributes  are  short  strings  and
              integers  that describe device hardware and firmware. They are concatenated to form
              the output that is similar to option -r but derived differently.

       -B action
              Press the simple connect pushbutton using VS_PB_ENC. The action can be specified by
              number  1,  2  or  3  or  by symbol &quot;join&quot;, &quot;leave&quot; or &quot;status&quot;, respectively. Send
              action
              is expectedoto leaveethehnetwork.xpected to join. Send action 2 to each device that

       -C module
              Commit  (flash)  downloaded  modules  to  NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM. The module can be
              spedified by number 1, 2 or 3 or by symbol &quot;nvm&quot;, &quot;pib&quot; or &quot;all&quot;, repectively. Mod‐
              ule  3 is equivalent to option -F which writes the NVM and PIB together. You cannot
              force flash NVRAM using this option. Use option -FF to force flash.

       -d filename
              Read Watchdog Report from the device and write it to the named file in binary  for‐
              mat  using VS_WD_RPT. The report file can be sent to Intellon Corporation for tech‐
              nical analysis. No assumptions are made based on filename and  no  filename  conve‐
              tions  are  enforced;  however,  you  should  use a .log file extension to indicate
              binary format.

       -D xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
              Define the 16 octet Device Access Key (DAK) in hex  format.  The  DAK  is  used  by
              option -J. It may also be set to &quot;key1&quot; or &quot;key2&quot; as explained in the KEYS section.

       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout. By convention status and  error  messages  are
              printed  on  stderr  while primary program output is printed on stdout. This option
              prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -f     Read device NVRAM parameters using VS_GET_NVM. An error will be  reported  when  no
              NVRAM  is present. This option can be used to determine if NVRAM is large enough to
              store the runtime firmware and parameter block.

       -F[F]  Write previously downloaded MAC and PIB to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM. Adding a  second
              F  here or another -F anywhere on the command line will force-flash a blank or cor‐
              rupted NVRAM. Firmware loaded from NVRAM will treat force-flash as an  error.  This
              option  can  be  used  to create factory settings but cannot be used to change them
              once created. Subsequent use creates and updates operational settings that  can  be
              erased  using a factory reset. This option is executed after all others on the com‐
              mand line, except for the -R option.

       -i interface
              Select the host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via  this  interface  and
              only  reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface is
              eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle network  connection;  however,
              if  environment  string  &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -I     Read the device PIB header using VS_RD_MOD and print the  firmware  major  revision
              number,  PIB minor revision number, Device Access Key (DAK), Network Membership Key
              (NMK), MAC address and other information on stdout.

       -J xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
              Set the Network Membership Key (NMK) on a  remote  device  using  VS_SET_KEY.  This
              option  is similar to option -K but requires the remote device MAC and DAK in addi‐
              tion to the NMK and local device MAC address. The NMK value is defined using option
              -K unless you want to use the default value. The remote DAK is defined using option
              -D unless you want to use the default value. Programming remote device keys is com‐
              plicated. It is often easier to connect the device directly to the host and use the
              -K option.

       -K xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
              Define the Network Membership Key (NMK) value used by options -M or  -J.  The  sym‐
              bolic names &quot;key1&quot; and &quot;key2&quot; are recognized as described in the KEY section.

       -l count
              Define the number of times that the command will be repeated for each device speci‐
              fied. Normally, you will repeat operations on one device only.

       -m     Read network membership information using VS_NW_INFO. This can be used to determine
              network configuration.

       -M     Set  the Network Membership Key (NMK) on the local device using VS_SET_KEY. The NMK
              value is specified using the -K option unless you want to use the default value.

       -n filename
              Read firmware from the device and write it to the named .nvm  file  using  multiple
              VS_RD_MOD  messages. No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename con‐
              ventions are enforced. This option is performed before  option  -N  when  both  are
              specified.

       -N filename
              Read  the  named .nvm file and write it to the device using multiple VS_WR_MOD mes‐
              sages. No assumptions are made based on filename and no  filename  conventions  are
              enforced;  however,  files having invalid .nvm format will be rejected. This option
              is executed after -n when both are specified.

       -p filename
              Read parameters from the device and write them to the named .pib file using  multi‐
              ple  VS_RD_MOD  messages. No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename
              convetions are enforced. This option is executed before option  BP  when  both  are
              specified.

       -P filename
              Read  the  named .pib file and write it to the device using multiple VS_WR_MOD mes‐
              sages. No assumptions are made based on filename and no  filename  conventions  are
              enforced;  however,  files having invalid .pib format will be rejected. This option
              is executed after -p when both are specified.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -Q     Quick flash. The program will not wait for a device to reset  or  the  firmware  to
              restart  after  writing  flash memory. This option is desirable with newer firmware
              that writes flash memory in the background. It  has  no  effect  unless  used  with
              option -F or -C.

       -r     Read  device  firmware  and hardware revision using VS_SW_VER. Output is similar to
              option -a but is derived differently.

       -R     Reset the device using VS_RS_DEV. This option is executed after all others  on  the
              same command line.

       -s     Read device SDRAM configuration using VS_RD_CBLOCK.

       -S filename
              Read  the named .cfg file and write it to the device using VS_SET_SDRAM. No assump‐
              tions are make based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced; however,
              files  having  an  invalid  .cfg  file format will be rejected. Do not confuse .cfg
              files with .config files. See chkcfg and config2cfg for more information  on  SDRAM
              configuration file formats.

       -t timer
              Read timeout or capture period in milliseconds. This value has different effects on
              Linux and Windows. On Linux, where native raw sockets are used, this is the maximum
              time  allowed for a response and so larger values should not affect performance. On
              Windows, where WinPcap is used, this is the time allotted for packet capture and so
              larger values will certainly affect performance. The default is 50 milliseconds.

       -T     Restore  factory  defaults.  This permanently erases all PIB changes made since the
              device was last programmed with factory default settings. The device will automati‐
              cally reset and reboot.

       -v     Print  additional  information on stdout. In particular, this option dumps incoming
              and outgoing packets which can be saved as text files for reference.

       -w seconds
              Defines the number of seconds to wait before repeating command line  options.  This
              option has no effect unless option -l is also specified with a non-zero value.

       -x     Cause  the  program to exit on the first error instead of continuing with remaining
              iterations, operations or devices. Normally, the program reports errors  and  moves
              on to the next operation, iteration or device depending on the command line.

       -?,--help
              Print  program  help  summary  on  stdout.  This option takes precedence over other
              options on the command line.

       -?,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This  option  takes  precedence  over
              other  options  on  the  command line. Use this option when sending screen dumps to
              Intellon Technical Support so that they know exactly which  version  of  the  Linux
              Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The  MAC  address of some powerline device. More than one address may be specified.
              If more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each  device
              in  turn.  The default address is local. See DEVICES for information about symbolic
              device addresses.

KEYS
       Passwords are variable length character strings that  end-users  can  remember.  Keys  are
       fixed length binary values created by encrypting passwords. There are two encryption algo‐
       rithms for HomePlugAV. One for DAKs and the other for NMKs. This means that a given  pass‐
       word  will  produce  different  keys  depending  on use. This program only deals with keys
       because that is what powerline devices recognize. The passwords that  generated  the  keys
       are irrelevant here.

       Encryption  keys  are  tedious to type and prone to error. For convenience, symbolic names
       have been assigned to common encryption keys and are recognized by options -D and -K.

       key1   Key for encrypted password &quot;HomePlugAV&quot;. This is &quot;689F074B8B0275A2710B0B5779AD1630&quot;
              for option -D and &quot;50D3E4933F855B7040784DF815AA8DB7&quot; for option -K.

       key2   Key       for      encrypted      password      &quot;HomePlugAV0123&quot;.      This      is
              &quot;F084B4E8F6069FF1300C9BDB812367FF&quot;        for         option         -D         and
              &quot;B59319D7E8157BA001B018669CCEE30D&quot; for option -K.

       none   Always &quot;00000000000000000000000000000000&quot;.

DEVICES
       Powerline  devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. MAC addresses are 12
       hexadecimal digits (0123456789ABCDEFabcdef) in upper,  lower  or  mixed  case.  Individual
       octets  may  be separated by colons, for clarity, but not all octets need to be seperated.
       For example, &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equiva‐
       lent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be expressed by name instead of number.

       all    Equivalent to &quot;broadcast&quot;, described next.

       broadcast
              A  synonym  for  the  standard  Ethernet  broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. All
              devices, whether local, remote or foreign will respond to this address.

       local  A synonym  for  the  Intellon  vendor  specific  Local  Management  Address  (LMA),
              00:B0:52:00:00:01.  All  local  Intellon  devices  will  recognize this address but
              remote and foreign devices will not. A remote device is any device at the  far  end
              of  a  powerline  connection.  A  foreign  device is any device not manufactured by
              Intellon.

DISCLAIMER
       Intellon HomePlug AV Vendor Specific Management Message structure and content  is  propri‐
       etary  to  Intellon  Corporation,  Ocala  FL  USA. Consequently, public information is not
       available. Intellon Corporation reserves the right to modify message structure or  content
       in  future  firmware releases without any obligation to notify or compensate users of this

EXAMPLES
          # int6k -n old.nvm -p old.pib -N new.nvm -P new.pib -F 01:23:45:67:89:AB

       Performs 5 operations on one device. Uploads the firmware and  PIB  from  the  device  and
       writes  them  to  files old.nvm and old.pib, respectively. Reads files new.nvm and new.pib
       and downloads them as new firmware and PIB, respectively. Commits the downloaded  firmware
       and  PIB  to  NVRAM. Operations are executed in the order just described regardless of the
       order specified on the command line. If you want reading and writing to occur in a differ‐
       ent  order  then  you  must  use two or more commands to accomplish tasks in the order you
       want.

          # int6k -N new.nvm 01:23:45:67:89:28
          # int6k -P new.pib 01:23:45:67:89:28
          # int6k -C 3 01:23:45:67:89:28

       It is not neccessary to specify all operations on one  command  line.  The  three  command
       lines  above  do essentially the same thing as the command line shown in the previou exam‐
       ple. Notice that this example uses -C 3, instead of -F, as an alternate way to  write  MAC
       and PIB to NVRAM. Specifying -C 1, instead, would write the .nvm file only. Specifying, -C
       2, instead, would write the .pib file only. THe value 3 is the logical OR of 1 and 2.

          # int6k -N new.nvm -P new.pib -FF local

       Downloads file new.nvm and file new.pib and force flashes the local device. Force flashing
       only  works  on  running firmware that has been downloaded and stated by the Intellon Boot
       Loader. See int6kf to download, start firmware and perform a force flash in one operation.

          # int6k -MK key1
          # int6k -M

       These  two  commands  are  equivalent.  They  set  the  NMK on the local device to key1 as
       descripted in the KEYS section. The first command resets the NMK on the local device  with
       -M  then  specifies  the NMK as key1. The second command omits the key specification since
       key1 is the program default NMK. One could, of course, type the encryption key.
