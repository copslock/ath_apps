nvramtest(7a)                         Intellon Linux Toolkit                        nvramtest(7a)

NAME
       nvramtest.nvm - NVRAM Diagnostic Applet

SYNOPSIS
       int6ktest nvramtest.nvm [...]

PURPOSE
       This  diagnostic  applet  has  been  replaced by applet flashtest. It is only provided for
       legacy support and will probably be removed from future toolkit releases so stop using it.

       This  diagnostic  applet  performs  a  connectivity  and data integrity test of an onboard
       NVRAM. The test consists of the five sub-tests described below. Each sub-test  depends  on
       the  successful  completion  of  the previous sub-test. Onboard NVRAM is left in an erased
       state on successful completion.

PREREQUISITES
       Bootloader software must be running.

SUBTESTS
       Onboard LEDs blink three times at the start of each test  to  show  progress.  Control  is
       returned  to  the  bootloader  after successful completion of all sub-tests. New users are
       encouraged to use the flashtest applet instead of this one because that  one  communicates
       by printing messages on the console instead of flashing device LEDs.

       If  any sub-test fails then the onboard LEDs will flash to indicate which test that failed
       and control will not return to the bootloader. On failure, the  LEDs  will  flash  quickly
       three  times then slowly several times then extringuish for several seconds. The number of
       slow flashes indicate the test number. This pattern  repeats  indefinitely.  Test  numbers
       start with 1.

       1 - JDEC ID Test
              Read JEDEC ID and compare it to known compatible 2mb and 4mb NVRAMs. If there is an
              open or a short on any on the four SPI lines then  this  sub-test  will  fail  with
              blinking  LEDs. Test failure could indicate a bad SPI line or poor component place‐
              ment or wrong component or bad component. This test completes quickly.

       2 - Bulk Erase
              Performs a bulk erase and verifies that all locations contain 0xFF. LED will  flash
              to indicate failure. Failure probably indicates a bad component. This test may take
              about 20 seconds to complete.

       3 - Write/Read Data Test
              Write the first 8 bytes of flash sector 0 with a floating 0 pattern and writes  the
              next  8 bytes with a 1’s fill pattern. then read the patterns back. LEDs will flash
              to indicates failure. Failure indicates bad NVRAM. This test completes quickly.

       4 - Address Test
              Write the first location of the next 8 sectors with a progressive data  patternsuch
              that  the  first  location of sector 1 is written with 1 then the first location of
              sector 2 is weritten with 2 and so on. Data is read and verified. Failure indicates
              bad NVRAM. This test completes quickly.

       5 - Sector Erase Test
              Sequentially erase all sectors. After each sector is erased, confirm that remaining
              sectiors retain data. Failure indicates a bad NVRAM. This test takes about 10  sec‐
              onds to complete.

EXAMPLES
       The following example uses program int6ktest to download and execute applet nvramtest.nvm.

          # int6ktest nvramtest.nvm
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Start Applet nvramtest.nvm (0)
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write Memory (00001000:2668)
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Wrote nvramtest.nvm
