.SH NAME
int6krate - Intellon PHY Rate Utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.Br int6krate
.RI [ options ] 
.RI [ device ] 
.RI [ device ] 
[...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Intellon PHY Rate Utility polls one or more devices and prints the average transmit and receive PHY rates between a device and each neighboring network device. Output is column-oriented and suitable for loading into a spreadsheet or being read by a simple program.
.P
This program is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the \fBilt\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-\fBd \fIseconds\fR
Traffic duration in seconds per connection. Directional traffic is systematically sent between each pair of powerline network devices for this period of time. Consequently, the total time needed to generate traffic between all network devices will be approximately \fBn!\fR times this value, so don't get carried away. The minimum value is \fB1\fR second and the maximum value is \fB60\fR seconds.
.TP
.RB - e
Redirects stderr messages to stdout. By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while primary program output is printed on stdout. This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.
.TP
-\fBi \fIinterface\fR
Select the host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this interface and only reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface is \fBeth1\fR because most people use \fBeth0\fR as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC" is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.
.TP
.RB - n
Reads the average transmit and receive PHY rate for wach device using VS_NW_INFO and prints it on stdout. Each output line displays the ethernet interface, source address, destination address and either the transmit or receive PHY rate. 
.TP
.RB - r
Reads device hardware and software revision information using VS_SW_VER and prints it on stdout.
.TP
.RB - R
Resets the device using VS_RS_DEV.
.TP
.RB - t
Generate powerline traffic between the local device and each remote device on each powerline network connected to the host. It does not generate any traffic between remote powerline device pairs. This option is especially useful when remote powerline devices are not connected to Ethernet devices capable of sending traffic back to the host.
.TP
.RB - T
Generate powerline traffic between all devices on each powerline network connected to the host. This option is similar to option \fB-t\fR but it takes much longer because traffic is systematically generated between each pair of powerline devices. Consequently, the time to complete will increase factorially as the number of network devices increases. Such complete traffic path coverage is not always needed.
.TP
.RB - q
Enter quiet mode. Progress messages are suppressed.
.RB -v
Enter verbose mode. All Etherenet frames sent or received by the program are displayed on stdout.
.TP
.RB - x
Exit program on first error with a non-zero exit code. This option allows shell scripts to detect failed or incomplete operations and take the appropriate action.
.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help
Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line. 
.TP
.RB - ! ,-- version
Print program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line. Use this option when sending screen dumps to Intellon Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.
.SH ARGUMENTS 
.TP
.B device
The MAC address of some powerline device. More than one address may be specified. If more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device in turn. The default address is \fBlocal\fR. See \fBDEVICES\fR for information about symbolic device addresses.
.SH DEVICES
Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12 hexadecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case. Octets may be separated with colons for clarity. For example, "00b052000001", "00:b0:52:00:00:01" and "00b052:000001" are valid and equivalent.
.PP
The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.
.TP
.BR all
Same as "broadcast".
.TP
.BR broadcast
A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address, \fBFF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF\fR. All devices, whether local, remote or foreign recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Intellon.
.TP
.BR local
A synonym for the Intellon vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), \fB00:B0:52:00:00:01\fR. All local Intellon devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not. A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Intellon.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example displays the average transmit and receive PHY rates from each of two devices. One is a local device connected to interface \fBeth2\fR and the other is a remote device at the far end of the powerline. In this case, they are the only two devices on the powerline network. Observe the recipricol rates shown.

   # int6krate -ni eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB
   eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB TX 163 mbps
   eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB RX 176 mbps

   eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:BB 00:B0:52:00:00:AA RX 176 mbps
.PP
The following example generates powerline traffic between the local device and each remote device because option \fB-t\fR is present. It then displays the PHY rate read from the local device.

   # int6krate -tni eth2 
   eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB TX 163 mbps
   eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB RX 176 mbps
