int6kboot - Intellon Boot Utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR int6kboot

.BR -N

.SH DESCRIPTION
Download and start runtime firmware on a local Intellon powerline device that is in bootloader mode. A device stays in bootloader mode when it cannot load firmware from NVRAM. That can happen because there is no NVRAM or because the NVRAM is blank or corrupted. The bootloader only understands a subset of Intellon message types and cannot flash NVRAM. This program uses that subset to download runtime firmware and start execution. Optionally, it will proceed to flash NVRAM after the firmware has started. 
.PP
Booting a device is a two part operation. The first part downloads an SDRAM configuration program into TCM and executes it then it downloads runtime firmware and parameters into SDRAM and starts the firmware. The second part downloads runtime firmare and parameters (again) into scratch buffers and instructs the firmware to write them into to NVRAM. This program can perform the first part alone or the first then the second part but not the second part alone. The second part can be performed alone using program \fBint6k\fR.
.PP
This program is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the \fBilt\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions. 
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.RB - e
Redirects stderr messages to stdout. By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while primary program output is printed on stdout. This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.
.TP
.RB - F [ F ]
Write previously downloaded MAC and PIB to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM. Adding a second \fBF\fR here or another -\fBF\fR anywhere on the command line will \fBforce-flash\fR a blank or corrupted NVRAM. Firmware loaded from NVRAM will treat force-flash as an error. This option can be used to create factory settings but cannot be used to change them once created. Subsequent use creates and updates operational settings that can be erased using a factory reset. This option is executed after all others on the command line, except for the -\fBR\fR option.
.TP
-\fB\i \fIinterface\fR
Select the host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this interface and only reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface is \fBeth1\fR because most people use \fBeth0\fR as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC" is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.
.TP 
-\fBN \fIfilename\fR
Read the named NVM file and write it to the device. This option and argument are required. Any file having an invalid NVM file format will be rejected. No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced.
.TP
-\fBP \fIfilename\fR
Read the named PIB file and write it to the device. This option and argument are required. Any file having an invalid PIB file format will be rejected. No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced.
.TP
.RB - q
Suppresses status messages on stderr. 
.TP
-\fBt \fItimer\fR
Read timeout or capture period in milliseconds. This value has different effects on Linux and Windows. On Linux, where native raw sockets are used, this is the maximum time allowed for a response and so larger values should not affect performance. On Windows, where WinPcap is used, this is the time allotted for packet capture and so larger values will certainly affect performance. The default is 50 milliseconds.
.TP
.RB - v
Prints additional information on stdout. In particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet packets on stdout.
.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help
Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line. 
.TP
.RB - ! ,-- version
Print program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line. Use this option when sending screen dumps to Intellon Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.
.SH ARGUMENTS
None.

.SH EXAMPLES
The -\fBN\fR and -\fBP\fR options are always required. Their order is not important. Notice that no MAC address is needed because devices always use address 00:B0:52:00:00:01 (the program default address) when in bootloader mode. Once this operation completes, firmware is running in SDRAM but the NVRAM, if present, has not been programmed. This operation is common for flash-less devices. If we reset the device at this point then the device will return to bootloader mode.

.PP
The next example does the same as the last example but performs extra steps needed to program NVRAM. It first downloads the firmware image from file \fBtest.nvm\fR and the parameter block image from file \fBtest.pib\fR using VS_WR_MEM and starts firmware execution using VS_ST_MAC. Once runtime firmware has started, it downloads the same firmware image and parameter block image using VS_WR_MOD and commits them to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM.
