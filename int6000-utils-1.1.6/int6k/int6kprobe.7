.RI [ options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
None.
.PP
This program is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the \fBilt\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR - c
Clear counters after read.
.TP
.RB - e
Redirects stderr messages to stdout. By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while primary program output is printed on stdout. This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.
.TP
-\fBi \fIinterface\fR
Select the host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this interface and only reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface is \fBeth1\fR because most people use \fBeth0\fR as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC" is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.
.TP
-\fBq\fR
Suppresses status messages on stderr. 
.TP
-\fBv\fR
Print additional information on stdout. In particular, this option dumps incoming and outgoing packets which can be saved as text files for reference.
.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help
Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line. 
.TP
.RB - ? ,-- version
Print program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line. Use this option when sending screen dumps to Intellon Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.IR device
The MAC address of some powerline device. More than one address may be specified. If more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device in turn. The default address is \fBlocal\fR. See \fBDEVICES\fR for information about symbolic device addresses.
.SH DEVICES
Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12 hexadecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case. Octets may be separated with colons for clarity. For example, "00b052000001", "00:b0:52:00:00:01" and "00b052:000001" are valid and equivalent.
.PP
The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.
.TP
.BR all
Same as "broadcast".
.TP
.BR broadcast
A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address, \fBFF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF\fR. All devices, whether local, remote or foreign recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Intellon.
.TP
.BR local
A synonym for the Intellon vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), \fB00:B0:52:00:00:01\fR. All local Intellon devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not. A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Intellon.
