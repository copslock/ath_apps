int6keth - Intellon Ethernet PHY Settings
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR int6keth
.RI [ options ] 
.RI [ device ] 
.RI [ device ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Read or write INT6x00 Ethernet PHY Settings using VS_ENET_SETTINGS.
.PP
This program is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the \fBilt\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-\fBa \fImode\fR
Advertise auto-negotiate capabilities. This option takes affect when option \fB-w\fR is present. It is ignored when option \fB-r\fR is present. Valid values are "\fB100Full\fR", "\fB100Half\fR", "\fB10Full\fR" and "\fB10Half\fR". The default value is no advertisement of capabilities.
.TP
-\fBd \fImode\fR
Device duplex transmission mode. This option takes affect when option \fB-w\fR is present. It is ignored when option \fB-r\fR is present. Valid values are "\fBHalf\fR" and "\fBFull\fR". The default value is "\fBHalf\fR".
.TP
.RB - e
Redirects stderr messages to stdout. By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while primary program output is printed on stdout. This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.
.TP
-\fBf \fIcontrol\fR
Flow control enable. This option takes affect when option \fB-w\fR is present. It is ignored when option \fB-r\fR is present. Valid values are "\fBOn\fR", "\fBOff\fR", "\fBTx\fR" and "\fBRx\fR". The default value is "\fBOff\fR".
.TP
-\fBn \fImode\fR
Auto-negotiate mode. This option takes affect when option \fB-w\fR is present. It is ignored when option \fB-r\fR is present. Valid values are "\fBOn\fR" and "\fBOff\fR". The default value is "\fBOn\fR".
.TP
-\fBs \fIspeed\fR
Network transmission speed in mbps. This option takes affect when option \fB-w\fR is present. It is ignored when option \fB-r\fR is present. Valid values are "\fB10\fR", "\fB100\fR" and "\fB1000\fR". The default value is "\fB10\fR".
.TP
-\fBi \fIinterface\fR
Select the host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this interface and only reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface is \fBeth1\fR because most people use \fBeth0\fR as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC" is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.
.TP
-\fBq\fR
Suppresses status messages on stderr. 
.TP
.RB - r
Read settings from the device instead of writing settings to the device. This option is the default and may be omitted. If omitted or present, options \fB-a\fR, \fB-d\fR, \fB-f\fR, \fB-n\fR and \fB-s\fR have no effect. 
.TP
-\fBv\fR
Print additional information on stdout. In particular, this option dumps incoming and outgoing packets which can be saved as text files for reference.
.TP
.RB - w
Write settings to the device instead of reading settings from the device. If omitted then settings are read from the device and displayed. If present, the user should specify all settings to avoid writing default values to the device.
.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help
Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line. 
.TP
.RB - ? ,-- version
Print program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line. Use this option when sending screen dumps to Intellon Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.IR device
The MAC address of some powerline device. More than one address may be specified on the command line. If more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device in turn. The default address is \fBlocal\fR. See \fBDEVICES\fR for information.
.SH DEVICES
Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12 hexadecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case. Octets may be separated with colons for clarity. For example, "00b052000001", "00:b0:52:00:00:01" and "00b052:000001" are valid and equivalent.
.PP
The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.
.TP
.BR all
Same as "broadcast".
.TP
.BR broadcast
A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address, \fBFF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF\fR. All devices, whether local, remote or foreign recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Intellon.
.TP
.BR local
A synonym for the Intellon vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), \fB00:B0:52:00:00:01\fR. All local Intellon devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not. A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Intellon.
