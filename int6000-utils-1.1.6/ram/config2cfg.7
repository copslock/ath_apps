.SH NAME
config2cfg \- Intellon Configuration File Converter
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBconfig2cfg\fR [\fBoptions\fR] \fBfile\fR [\fBfile\fR] [\fB...\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBconfig2cfg\fR program converts an SDRAM configuration file used by the Windows Device Manager to the configuration file format used by the Linux Toolkit. 
.P
This program is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the \fBilt\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.
.SH OPTIONS
There are no options.
.SH EXPLANATION
The Windows Device Manager format consists of 64 ASCII hexadecomal characters and usually have a \fB.config\fR extension. File size is at least 64 characters. Excess characters are ignored in input. Files can be modified with any text editor. There is no way to detect modification. ASCII to binary convertion and checksum computation is required on input. Binary to ASCII conversion iw required on output.
.P
The Linux Toolkit foremat consists of 32 binary bytes plus a 4 byte (32 bit) checksum and usually have a \fB.cfg\fR extension. File size is exactly 36 characters. The files can be edited using any hex editor but a new checksum must be computed and inserted after any change. No conversion or computation is required on input or output.
.P
You can use the \fBchkcfg\fR utility to determine if a given file has the proper Linux Toolkit SDRAM configuration file format. Programs \fBint6k\fR and \fBint6kf\fR expect this format.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fIfile\fR
The filename of a Windows Device Manager SDRAM configuration file. The file is re-written such that the filename is preserved but the contents are not. Windows Device Manager SDRAM configuration files usually have a \fB.config\fR extension but the program makes no assumption based on filename and does not enforce any filename conventions.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR
Suppresses printing of progress messages. There are no progress messages in this version.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Print additional information. There is no additional information printed in this version.
.TP
\fB-?\fR, \fB--help\fR
Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line. 
.TP
\fB-!\fR, \fB--version\fR
Print program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line. Usethis option when sending screen dumps to Intellon Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following example reads file abc.cfg and validates it. The message shown indicates that the configuration file is the correct size and has a checksums and there are no read errors.
.P
    > chkcfg abc.cfg
    chkcfg: abc.cfg looks good
.P
The following example reads three files in succession and reports on each one. You can suppress good news with the \fB-q\fR option.
.P
    # chkcfg abc.cfg def.cfg ghi.cfg
    chkcfg: abc.cfg looks good
    chkcfg: def.cfg is corrupt
    chkcfg: ghi.cfg looks good
.P
The following example displays the SDRAM configuration values in all files having names that match the wildcard pattern \fBsdram*.cfg\fR. We can confirm that the values inside are correct for their filenames. Program output could have been sent to a file and saved for later reference.
.P
    # chknvm -qv sdram*.cfg
