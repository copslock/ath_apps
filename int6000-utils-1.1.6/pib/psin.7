.TH psin 7 "Intellon Corporation" "int6000-utils-linux" "Intellon Linux Toolkit"
.SH NAME
psin - Import PIB Prescalers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR psin 
.RI [ options ]
.RI [< stdin ]
.IR file 
.SH SYNOPSIS
Import an amplitude map, read from stdin, and insert it into and existing PIB file, replacing previous amplitude map values. Intellon can provide standard amplitude maps (or \fBprescalers\fR) that conform to most national or international EMI regulations. Generally speaking, these maps should not be modified but there are execeptions. This program permits custom amplitude maps to be loaded into an PIB file. It can also be used to copy a map directly from one PIB file to another when used with program \fBpsout\fR.
.PP
This program is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the \fBilt\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.
.SH CAVEATS
The Intellon Windows Device Manager determines the type of prescalars stored in the PIB by inspecting the \fBToneMaskType\fR code which is also stored in the PIB but is not part of the prescalar set. If this program is used to store a new prescalar set in a PIB and the ToneMaskType code is not updated to reflect the change then the Windows Device Manager will continue to display the previous prescalar type. This will confuse Windows Device Manager users. Use program \fBsetpib\fR to set the \fBToneMaskType\fR code and program \fBpskey\fR to verify the true prescalar type. 
.PP
Tampering with prescalar settings may violate national or international electo-magnetic emission standards and lead to fines or penalties. Intellon Corporation shall not be held responsible for any consequences of modifications made to prescalar sets provided to their customers.
.SH OPTIONS
None.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.IR file
The name of an Intellon Parameter Information Block (\fBPIB\fR) file. The original prescalers are replaced and the checksum is re-computed. By convention, PIB files have a \fB.pib\fR extension but this program does not enforce that convention and does not make any assumption based on filename or extension but the program will reject invalid PIB files. Only one file may be specified on the command line.
.SH FILES
An amplitude map consists of 1155 frequency-amplitude pairs. Each pair consists of a decimal \fBindex\fR and a hexadecimal \fBscaler\fR value. The index represents a frequecy from 1.8 mhz through 30 mhz. The \fBscaler\fR represents the amplitude attenuation applied at that frequency. The frequency and attenuation are computed as follows.
.PP
   \fBfrequency = 40.96 * (index + 74)\fR 
   \fBdecibels = 20 * log10 (scaler / 256)\fR
.SH EXAMPLE
The following example loads prescaler file \fBabc.psc\fR into PIB file \fBabc.pib\fR. The \fBToneMaskType\fR code is not updated by this operation and should be updated separately to avoid confusing Windows Device Manager users. Program \fBsetpib\fR is one means of updating this code.
.PP
   # psin < abc.psc abc.pib

PIB file structure and content is proprietary to Intellon Corporation, Ocala FL USA. Consequently, public information is not available.
