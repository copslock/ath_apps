.SH NAME
weeder - Weeder Solid State Relay Module controller 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR weeder
.RI [ options ]
.BR attenuation
.SH DESCRIPTION
Set attenuation level on the Intellon Production Test System using a local RS-232 communication port. 
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-\fBe\fI echo\fR
Enable or disable echo mode. The value of \fBecho\fR can be \fB1\fR=on or \fB0\fR=off. Alternately, keywords "\fBon\fR" and "\fBoff\fR" can be used. Intellon recommends that you always disable echo when using this program to speed relay switching.
.TP
-\fBm\fI mode\fR
Enable or disable attenuation. The value of \fBmode\fR can be \fB1\fR=on or \fB0\fR=off. Alternately, keywords "\fBon\fR" and "\fBoff\fR" can be used.
.TP
-\fBo\fI units\fR
Change relay control module order. Individual relay control modules are assigned a digital addresses that can be referenced using the UTF-8 letters "[A-P]" then "[a-p]". The Intellon PTS is configured so that module "B" is activated before module "A". This options lets you specify some other module order. The default value is "BA".
.TP
-\fBp\fI file\fR
The name of the serial port. On Linux, the name is usually "/dev/ttyS[0-4]". On OS/X, the name is usually "/dev/cua[0-4]". On Windows, the name is "com[0-4]:". The default is "/dev/ttyS0" on Linux and "com1:" on Windows.
.TP
-\fBw\fI wait\fR
Wait time in milliseconds. Serial I/O operation are slow and a delay is needed after each write operation. Unfortunately, different operating systems require different wait times. This options lets you adjust the time. The default is 10 milliseconds which should be adequate on most systems. 
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.BR attenuation
The desired attenuation in decibels. The value may be expressed in decimal, binary or hexadecimal. Binary values start with "0b" and hexadecimal values start with "0x".
.SH PORT SETTINGS
You must configure communications port settings before running this program. Settings are 9600 baud, no parity, 8 data and 1 stop bit. See datasheet \fIhttp://www.weedtech.com/wtssr-m.pdf\fR for more information.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following example turns the Weeder controller on and configures it for \fB72\fRdb attenuation. Option \fB-m\fR is not necessary if the controller is already on.
.PP
   # weeder -m 1 72
.PP
The next example configures the controller for \fB42\fRdb attenuation. There is no needed to turn the controller on again because it remains on until turned off.
.PP
   # weeder 42
.PP
The next example configures the controller for \fB56\fRdb attenuation and turns the controller off. Unfortunately, the actual state of the controller is unpredictable. This means that the attentuation argument should probably be omitted when turning the device off.
.PP
   # weeder -m off 56
