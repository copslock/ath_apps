.TH fdm 7 "Intellon Corporation" "int6000-utils-linux" "Intellon Linux Toolkit"
.SH NAME
fdm - PIB Notching Script 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR fdm.sh
.RI [ mode ] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
A script to program an Intellon HomePlug AV Powerline Device with a known set of prescalar values. Prescalar values tell runtime firware to attenuate or ignore specific powerline frequencies. Prescalar sets are provided by Intellon as files that may be selected by number from a menu printed by this script. This number is called the notching \fBmode\fR. 
.PP
The script will read a device PIB into a temporary file, replace the prescalars in that file, write that file back to the device and commit it to NVRAM. The script and associated prescalar files are all needed for proper operation. Users may edit script variables or modify script logic to suit their requirements.
.PP
This program is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the \fBilt\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.
.SH OPTIONS
None.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.IR mode
The notching mode. Mode values are listed in the script menu. Each mode corresponds to a prescalar file that will be used to modify the device PIB using program \fBpsin\fR. If omitted, a \fImode\fR menu will be displayed an no action will occur.
.SH FILES
.TP
.BR fdm.sh
A Linux bash version of fdm.bat. Users should edit script paramters \fBETH\fR, \fBDIR\fR and \fBDEV\fR, as explained below, before running this script. The Intellon Linux Toolkit must be installed for proper script execution.
.TP
.BR fdm.bat
A Microsoft DOS version of \fBfdm.sh\fR.  Users should edit script paramters \fBETH\fR, \fBDIR\fR and \fBDEV\fR, as explained below, before running this script. The Intellon Linux Toolkit must be installed for proper script execution. 
.TP
.BR scripts/prescaler
A folder containing prescalar files. There is one prescalar file for each notching mode. All files must reside in folder \fBDIR\fR as defined in the script file. If you change file names then you must also edit both script files to relfect that change.
.SH VARIABLES
There are four variables defined at the start of the script. These variables permit relocation of the script and/or the prescalar files.
.TP
.BR ETH
The name or the number of the host network interface used to communicate with the powerline device.  On Linux, the name will typicall be "eth0" or "eth1". On Windows, the number will typically be 2 or 3. This variable is expanded and passed to toolkit programs using option \fB-i\fR. 
.TP
.BR DIR
The absolute or relative path of the folder containing the prescalar files. Prescalar files are located in toolkit folder \fBscripts/prescalers\fR. You may move them to another folder but must edit this variable so that they can be located when the script is executed. 
.TP
.BR PIB
The temporary PIB filename. This file holds the PIB read from a device while it is being modified. Make sure that this filename does not conflict with other files by the same name.
.TP
.BR DEV 
The hardware address of the powerline device to be modified. You can use keyword \fBlocal\fR which translates to the Local Management Address (\fB00:B0:52:00:00:01\fR) or specify the actual MAC address of a remote powerline device.
.SH EXAMPLES
To display available modes, type the script filename but omit the \fImode\fR argument. Available modes are listed along with the corresponding range of frequencies to be notched.

   Intellon fdm mode utility
   
   usage: fdm mode
   
   mode = "1" 2.01MHz to 27.90Mhz w/HAM bands notched
   mode = "2" 2.01Mhz to 7.08MHz w/no notches
   mode = "3" 2.01Mhz to 7.54MHz w/HAM and Aero notches
   mode = "4" 2.01Mhz to 11.91Mhz w/no notches
   mode = "5" 2.01MHz to 11.91MHz w/ HAM and Aero notches
   mode = "6a" 2.0Mhz to 13.0Mhz w/HAM bands notched
   mode = "6b" 17.0Mhz to 28.0Mhz w/HAM bands notched
   mode = "7a" 2.0MHz to 10.1MHz w/HAM bands notched
   mode = "7b" 14.3MHz to 28.0MHz w/HAM bands notched
   mode = "8a" 2.0MHz to 16.0MHz w/HAM bands notched
   mode = "8b" 21.0MHz to 28.0MHz w/HAM bands notched
   mode = "9a" 2.0MHz to 9.0MHz w/HAM bands notched
   mode = "9b" 11.0MHz to 17.0MHz w/HAM bands notched
   mode = "9c" 22.0MHz to 28.0MHz w/HAM bands notched
.PP
This example will notch a device from 2.0Mhz to 10.0Mhz because we specified \fImode\fR as \fB6a\fR. The affected device is determined by variable \fBDEV\fR. The assiciated prescaler file from the folder defined by variable \fBDIR\fR will be used. A brief confirmation message will appear.
.PP
   # fdm.sh 6a
   
   Setting modem to 2.0Mhz to 13.0Mhz w/HAM bands notched
