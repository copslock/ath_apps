.SH NAME
hpav - HomePlug AV Packet Listener
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR hpav 
.RI [ options ] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
Displays HomePlug AV ethernet frames transmitted by a HomePlug AV device to the host. It does not display HomePlug AV frames from the host to the device or HomePlug AV frames transmitted over powerline unless they have been forwarded to the host via the local device.
.PP
The program is an example of a simple packet listener and daemon. Consequently, it lacks features. Engineers and software developers can use it to build custom applications. The framework is present but details must be modified or added.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-\fBi \fIinterface\fR
Names the host ethernet interface to watch. The named interface, such as eth0, eth1 and so on, must be connected to a HomePlug AV ethernet-to-powerline bridge adapter to receive any HomePlug AV traffic. The default interface is \fBeth1\fR.
.TP
.RB - q
Quiet mode. Suppress the printing of the normal message descriptions on \fBstdout\fR.
.TP
.RB - v
Verbose mode. Displays incoming frames in hexadecimal dump format on \fBstdout\fR. This option is independent of option \fB-a\fR which prints VS_ARPC message text on stderr.
.TP
-\fB?\fR, --\fBhelp\fR
Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line. 
.TP
-\fB!\fR, --\fBversion\fR
Print program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line. Usethis option when sending screen dumps to Intellon Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.
See the HomePlug AV Specification for a description of all HomePlug AV message types. See the Intellon INT6000 Firmware Reference Manual for a description of Intellon Vendor Specific message types.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following command monitors the default interface \fBeth1\fR for HomePlug AV traffic and dumps detected frames on the console as they occur. Terminate the foreground process by typing ^C or ^Z at the console. This program is usually run in a seperate console window when performing other toolkit operations. 
.PP
   # hpav
.PP
The following command monitors host interface \fBeth4\fR for incoming HomePlug AV frames and dumps writes them to file \fBhpav.log\fR. Frames are printed in hexadecimal dump format because option \fB-v\fR is present. Terminate the foreground process by typing ^C or ^Z at the console.  
.PP
   # hpav -v -i eth4 > hpav.log
