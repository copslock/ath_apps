.SH DESCRIPTION
Print an object driven dump on stdout. An object driven dump requires an object definition file that contains the size and name of data regions and members within a binary object or file. Individual data members are presented as independent data dumps within the larger, overall data dump.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-\fBf\fI definitions\fR
The name of the object definition file that contains the size, name and description of objects within a binary file. The definition file is not modified. This option is required. There is no default file.
.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help
Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line. 
.TP
.RB - ! ,-- version
Print program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line. Usethis option when sending screen dumps to Intellon Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.IR file
The name of a binary file. More than one binary file may be specified but each should conform to the object definition file or output will not be correct. 
.SH EXAMPLES
The following is an example object definition file for an Ethernet frame. Frame fields, like \fBODA\fR, \fBOSA\fR and \fBETHTYPE\fR,  are defined by \fIlength\fR in order of their appears in the frame. Array subscripts following object names are optional but, if present, become part of the object name. Fields having no \fIlength\fR are headers and will be ignored. Comments and blank lines are also ignored.
