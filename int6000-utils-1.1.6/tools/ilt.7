.SH NAME
Intellon Linux Toolkit 
.SH SYNOPSIS
Intellon Corporation, Ocala FL USA, provides this \fBIntellon Linux Toolkit\fR to customers free of charge. The toolkit contains C Language source code and GNU makefiles to compile several useful programs. It also includes shell scripts that use these programs, in various ways, to interrogate, control and manage Intellon powerline devices. These programs are intended for hardware engineers and embedded software developers, consequently, they are simple and compact by design. They are not intended for end users or computer novices.
.SH INSTALLATION
The Intellon Linux Toolkit is distributed as a tarball named \fBint6000-utils-x.x.x.tar.gz\fR. Unpack the tarball and change to the directory that it creates. To compile the source code, type "\fBmake\fR". To install the programs, type "\fBmake install\fR". To install man pages, type "\fBmake manuals\fR". To uninstall programs and man pages, type "\fBmake uninstall\fR". To read about the Toolkit, browse file \fBdocbook/index.html\fR. This package does not automatically install scripts or html pages and so you must copy them to preferred locations. 
.PP
We recommend that you login as root before installing this package; otherwise, you will be prompted for the root password as each component is installed. Programs are installed in /usr/local/bin. Man pages are installed in /usr/share/man/man[1-9]. If these folders are not correct for your system, or if you want to install in other folders, then edit folder names defined in the \fBMakefile\fR in each package folder. The package has been compiled in a variety of Linux distributions, including redhat, debian, ubuntu and monta vista. They have also been cross-compiled for MIPS but Intellon does not provide support for cross compilation efforts. 
.PP
Although this package has been compiled on several platforms, there is no guarantee that it will compile without errors or warnings on non-GNU/Linux platforms. We continuously update the package but do not attempt to compile or test it on systems other than GNU/Linux and Microsoft VisualStudio .NET. Some programs have been excluded from the Windows installation for technical reasons.
.SH BACKGROUND
\fBHomePlug 1.0\fR and \fBHomePlug AV\fR are industry standard protocols for powerline communications. Intellon manufactures a family of chipsets that conform to these standards and have various USBm PCI, MII and Ethernet interfaces. The INT5100 and INT5200 are the cornerstones of the Intellon chipset family. The INT6000, INT6300 and INT6400 chipsets are the flagship members of the Intellon chipset family. 
.PP
The \fBHomePlug 1.0\fR protocol is based on IEEE-802.3, has ethertype 0x887B and uses special message formats.
.PP
The \fBHomePlug AV\fR protocol is based on IEEE-802.3, has ethertype 0x88E1 and uses special message formats. A subset of those message formats are unspecified so that chipset vendors can define message formats for their own products. Intellon uses this subset to communicate between host processors and Intellon devices. Intellon vendor specific management message formats are described in the Intellon HomePlugAV Firmware Technical Reference Manual. This toolkit uses Intellon vendor specific message formats to communicates with Intellon devices and reads or writes Intellon specific file formats. 
.PP
Each program in the toolkit deals with a narrow aspect of Intellon device management but any or all can be called from shell scripts to perform complex tasks. With them, one can identify chipset hardware and firmware version, reset devices, flash devices, identify other Intellon network devices, validate *.pib and *.nvm files, sniff HomePlug AV Ethernet frames, send generic Ethernet frames and so on. 
.PP
The source code is designed to demonstrate and educate and may be modified without obligation to Intellon. Intellon would appreciate feedback concerning changes that improve the useability, reliability or efficiency. Keep in mind that these tools are intended to be small and simple.
