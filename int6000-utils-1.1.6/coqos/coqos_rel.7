.SH NAME
coqos_rel - Release Bandwidth Management
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR coqos_rel
.RI [ options ]
.IR cid
.RI [ device ]
[...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B This page is under construction.
.PP
Instructs one or more devices to stop managing a stream. Use this program when bandwidth management is no longer needed or wanted. Use program \fBcoqos_mod\fR to suspend and resume bandwidth management of a stream. 
.PP
This program is part of the Intellon Linux Toolkit. See the \fBilt\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.RB - e
Redirects stderr messages to stdout. By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while primary program output is printed on stdout. This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.
.TP
-\fBi \fIinterface\fR
Select the host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this interface and only reponses received via this interface are recognized. The default interface is \fBeth1\fR because most people use \fBeth0\fR as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC" is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.
.TP
.RB - q
Suppresses status messages on stderr. 
.TP
.RB - r
Display relative memory offsets on output. This option is the default.
.TP
.RB - v
Prints additional information on stdout. In particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet packets on stdout.
.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help   
Displays program help information on stderr. This option takes precedence over all other options on the command line except version information.
.TP
.RB - ! ,-- version
Displays program version information on stderr. This option takes precedence over all other options on the command line except help information. Use this option when sending screen dumps to Intellon technical staff.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.IR cid
The connection identifier of the affected stream.
.TP
.IR device
The MAC address of some powerline device. More than one address may be specified on the command line. If more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device in turn. The default address is "\fBlocal\fR". See \fBDEVICES\fR for more information.
.SH DEVICES
Ethernet MAC addresses are expressed as six hexadecimal octets optionally separated by colon. For example, the Intellon Local Management Address (LMA) of "00b052000001" may also be entered as "00:b0:52:00:00:01" or "00b052:000001". Addresses are case insensitive and quotes are optional. In addition, some special addresses may be entered by name rather than number where names are case sensitive.
.TP
.BR all
A synonym for the "broadcast" address, described next.
.TP
.BR broadcast
A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address, \fBFF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF\fR. All devices, whether local, remote or foreign will respond to this address.
.TP
.BR local
A synonym for the Intellon vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), \fB00:B0:52:00:00:01\fR. All local Intellon devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not. A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Intellon.
