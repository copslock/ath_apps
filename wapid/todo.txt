1. per-STA statistics of  WPI Replay Counters, WPI Decryptable Errors, WPI MIC Errors
   These three counters need supporting from WLAN driver. 
   Note: The per-VAP statistics of these counters has been implemented.

2. BK reauthetication
    There is no STA available who supports  BK Reauth currently, 
    so this feature has not be tested sufficiently.

3. PRE AUTH
    This feature has not been implemented, and there is no STA avalilable too.
